This site hosts resources developed by the Earth Lab team at University of Colorado,
Boulder. This website contains data, code tutorials, data-intensive course
materials and blog posts related to our work. Most of the
[data tutorials]({{ site.url }}/tutorials/)
building `R` and `Python` skills relevant to earth systems analytics, including geospatial,
social, biological, and earth systems data. The [data-intensive course materials]({{ site.url }}/courses/) focus on a suite of topics including:

* Geospatial analysis
* Open, reproducible science
* Spatio-temporal data
* Heterogeneous data structures
* Remote sensing


## What is the Definition of Earth Data Science?

Earth data science is an emerging and growing field that combines Earth sciences 
domain knowledge with data science skills to study enviornmental topics.Earth 
systems data can be combined with demographic, social and behavioral data to 
understand how humans interact with and impact their environment. Understanding 
these changes and interactions is critical to both scientific efforts to address
important environmental issues and industry efforts to build new and innovative 
tools. Earth data science education is key to training the next generation of
scientists.

## Our Team

Our mission is to both capitalize on the data deluge from Space and other
platforms to accelerate science and to train a new generation of data scientists
who can apply their knowledge to addressing outstanding Earth Science questions.
Our team approaches Earth analytics from a diverse set of perspectives, with
backgrounds in high performance computing, statistics, visualization, and
applied science.
