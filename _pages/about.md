This site hosts resources developed by the Earth Lab team at University of Colorado,
Boulder. This website contains data, code tutorials, data-intensive course
materials and blog posts related to our work. Most of the
[data tutorials]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/tutorials/)
building `R` and `Python` skills relevant to earth systems analytics, including geospatial,
social, biological, and earth systems data. The [data-intensive course materials]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/course-materials/) focus on a suite of topics including:

* Geospatial analysis
* Open, reproducible science
* Spatio-temporal data
* Heterogeneous data structures
* Remote sensing



## Our Team

Our mission is to both capitalize on the data deluge from Space and other
platforms to accelerate science and to train a new generation of data scientists
who can apply their knowledge to addressing outstanding Earth Science questions.
Our team approaches Earth analytics from a diverse set of perspectives, with
backgrounds in high performance computing, statistics, visualization, and
applied science.
