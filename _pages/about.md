This site hosts resources developed by
<a href="http://www.colorado.edu/earthlab" target = "_blank">Earth Lab at University of Colorado,
Boulder</a>. This website contains tutorials course lessons and blog posts related
to earth data science. Most of the
[data tutorials]({{ site.url }}/tutorials/)
will teach you important `R` and `Python` techniques relevant to
earth data analytics, including geospatial,
social, biological, and earth systems data. The [earth analytics course lessons]({{ site.url }}/courses/) focus on a suite of topics including:

* Geospatial analysis
* Open, reproducible science
* Spatio-temporal data
* Heterogeneous data structures
* Remote sensing
* and more!
