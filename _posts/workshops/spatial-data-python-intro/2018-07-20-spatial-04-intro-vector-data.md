## About Vector Data

Vector data are composed of discrete geometric locations (x, y values) known as **vertices** that define the "shape" of the spatial object. The organization of the vertices determines the type of vector that you are working 
with. There are three types of vector data: 

* **Points:** Each individual point is defined by a single x, y coordinate. There can be many points in a vector point file. Examples of point data include: sampling locations, the location of individual trees or the location of plots.

* **Lines:** Lines are composed of many (at least 2) vertices, or points, that are connected. For instance, a road or a stream may be represented by a line. This line is composed of a series of segments, each "bend" in the road or stream represents a vertex that has defined `x, y` location.

* **Polygons:** A polygon consists of 3 or more vertices that are connected and "closed". Thus the outlines of plot boundaries, lakes, oceans, and states or countries are often represented by polygons. Occasionally, a polygon can have a hole in the middle of it (like a doughnut), this is something to be aware of but not an issue you will deal with in this tutorial.

</figure>


<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip:** Sometimes, boundary layers such as states and countries, are stored as lines rather than polygons. However, these boundaries, when represented as a line, will not create a closed object with a defined "area" that can be "filled".
{: .notice--warning }


## Shapefiles: Points, Lines, and Polygons
Geospatial data in vector format are often stored in a `shapefile` format. Because the structure of points, lines, and polygons are different, each individual shapefile can only contain one vector type (all points, all lines 
or all polygons). You will not find a mixture of point, line and polygon objects in a single shapefile.

Objects stored in a shapefile often have a set of associated `attributes` that describe the data. For example, a line shapefile that contains the locations of streams, might contain the associated stream name, stream "order" and other 
information about each stream line object.

* More about shapefiles can found on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>.

## One Dataset - Many Files

While text files often are self contained (one CSV) is composed of one unique file, many spatial formats are composed of several files. A shapefile is created by 3 or more files, all of which must retain the same NAME and be
stored in the same file directory, in order for you to be able to work with them.

### Shapefile Structure

There are 3 key files associated with any and all shapefiles:

* **`.shp`:** the file that contains the geometry for all features.
* **`.shx`:** the file that indexes the geometry.
* **`.dbf`:** the file that stores feature attributes in a tabular format.

These files need to have the **same name** and to be stored in the same directory (folder) to open properly in a GIS, `R` or `Python` tool.

Sometimes, a shapefile will have other associated files including:

* `.prj`: the file that contains information on projection format including
the coordinate system and projection information. It is a plain text file
describing the projection using well-known text (WKT) format.
* `.sbn` and `.sbx`: the files that are a spatial index of the features.
* `.shp.xml`: the file that is the geospatial metadata in XML format, (e.g. ISO 19115 or XML format).

## Data Management - Sharing Shapefiles

When you work with a shapefile, you must keep all of the key associated file types together. And when you share a shapefile with a colleague, it is important to zip up all of these files into one package before you send it to
them!

## Import Shapefiles
You will use the `geopandas` library to work with vector data in `Python`. You will also use `matplotlib.pyplot` to plot your data. 

{:.input}
```python
# import necessary packages
import geopandas as gpd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import os
import earthpy as et

# set home directory and download data
et.data.get_data("spatial-vector-lidar")
os.chdir(os.path.join(et.io.HOME, 'earth-analytics'))
```

The shapefiles that you will import are:

* A polygon shapefile representing our field site boundary,
* A line shapefile representing roads, and
* A point shapefile representing the location of field sites at the <a href="http://www.neonscience.org/science-design/field-sites/harvard-forest" target="_blank"> San Joachin field site</a>.

The first shapefile that you will open contains the point locations of plots where trees have been measured. To import shapefiles you use the `geopandas` function `read_file()`. Notice that you call the `read_file()` function using `gpd.read_file()` to tell python to look for the function within the `geopandas` library.


{:.input}
```python
# import shapefile using geopandas
sjer_plot_locations = gpd.read_file('data/spatial-vector-lidar/california/neon-sjer-site/vector_data/SJER_plot_centroids.shp')
```

The CRS **UTM zone 18N**. The CRS is critical to interpreting the object `extent` values as it specifies units.

## Spatial Data Attributes

Each object in a shapefile has one or more attributes associated with it.
Shapefile attributes are similar to fields or columns in a spreadsheet. Each row
in the spreadsheet has a set of columns associated with it that describe the row
element. In the case of a shapefile, each row represents a spatial object - for
example, a road, represented as a line in a line shapefile, will have one "row"
of attributes associated with it. These attributes can include different types
of information that describe objects stored within a shapefile. Thus, our road,
may have a name, length, number of lanes, speed limit, type of road and other
attributes stored with it.

    in the spatial object.

</figure>

You can view the attribute table associated with our geopandas `GeoDataFrame` by simply typing the object name into the console
(e.g., `sjer_plot_locations`).

Her you've used the `.head(3)` function to only display the first 3 rows of the attribute table. Remember that the number in the `.head()` function represents the total number of rows that will be returned by the function.

```python
# view  the top 6 lines of attribute table of data

In this case, you have several attributes associated with our points including:

* Plot_ID, Point, easting, geometry, northing, plot_type

{: .notice--warning }


### The Geopandas Data Structure

Notice that the geopandas data structure is a `data.frame` that contains a `geometry` column where the x, y point location values are stored. All of the other shapefile feature attributes are contained in columns, similar to what you may be used to if you've used a GIS tool such as ArcGIS or QGIS.

## Shapefile Metadata & Attributes

When you import the `SJER_plot_centroids` shapefile layer into `Python` the `gpd.read_file()` function automatically stores information about the data as attributes. You are particularly interested in the geospatial **metadata**, describing the format, `CRS`, `extent`, and other components of the vector data, and the **attributes** which describe properties associated with each individual vector object.


## Spatial Metadata

Key metadata for all shapefiles include:

1. **Object Type:** the class of the imported object.
2. **Coordinate Reference System (CRS):** the projection of the data.
3. **Extent:** the spatial extent (geographic area that the shapefile covers) of the shapefile. Note that the spatial extent for a shapefile represents the extent for ALL spatial objects in the shapefile.

You can view shapefile metadata using the `class()`, `.crs` and `.total_bounds` methods:


{:.input}
```python
type(sjer_plot_locations)
```

{:.output}
{:.execute_result}



    geopandas.geodataframe.GeoDataFrame





{:.input}
```python
# view the spatial extent
sjer_plot_locations.total_bounds
```

{:.output}
{:.execute_result}



    array([ 254738.618, 4107527.074,  258497.102, 4112167.778])

    <figcaption>The spatial extent of a shapefile or geopandas GeoDataFrame represents

    </figcaption>
</figure>

{:.input}
```python
sjer_plot_locations.crs
```

{:.output}
{:.execute_result}



    {'init': 'epsg:32611'}





The CRS for our data is epsg code: `32611`. You will learn about CRS formats and structures in a later lesson but for now a quick google search reveals that this CRS is: <a href="http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/wgs-84-utm-zone-11n/" target="_blank">UTM zone 11 North - WGS84</a>.


{:.input}
```python
sjer_plot_locations.geom_type
```

{:.output}
{:.execute_result}

    1     Point
    2     Point

    15    Point
    16    Point
    17    Point
    dtype: object





## How Many Features Are in Your Shapefile? 

You can view the number of features (counted by the number of rows in the attribute table) and feature attributes (number of columns) in our data using the pandas `.shape` method. Note that the data are returned as a vector of two values:

(rows, columns) 

Also note that the number of columns includes a column where the geometry (the x, y coordinate locations) are stored. 

{:.input}
```python
sjer_plot_locations.shape
```

{:.output}
{:.execute_result}



    (18, 6)






# Plot a Shapefile

Next, you can visualize the data in your `Python` `geodata.frame` object using the `.plot()` method. Notice that you can create a plot using the geopandas base plotting using the syntax:

`dataframe_name.plot()`

The plot is made larger but adding a figsize = () argument. 

{:.input}
```python
# plot the data using geopandas .plot() method
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize = (10,10))
sjer_plot_locations.plot(ax=ax);
```

{:.output}
{:.display_data}

<figure>

<img src = "{{ site.url }}/images/workshops/spatial-data-python-intro/2018-07-20-spatial-04-intro-vector-data/2018-07-20-spatial-04-intro-vector-data_18_0.png">

</figure>




You can plot the data by feature attribute and add a legend too. Below you add the following plot arguments to your geopandas plot:

* **column:** the attribute column that you want to plot your data using
* **categorical=True:** set the plot to plot categorical data - in this case plot types. 
* **legend:** add a legend
* **markersize:** increase or decrease the size of the points or markers rendered on the plot
* **cmap:** set the colors used to plot the data

and fig size if you want to specify the size of the output plot. 

{:.input}
```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize = (10,10))

# quickly plot the data adding a legend
sjer_plot_locations.plot(column='plot_type', 
                         categorical=True, 
                         legend=True, 
                         figsize=(10,6),
                         markersize=45, 
                         cmap="Set2", ax=ax);
```

{:.output}
{:.display_data}

<figure>

<img src = "{{ site.url }}/images/workshops/spatial-data-python-intro/2018-07-20-spatial-04-intro-vector-data/2018-07-20-spatial-04-intro-vector-data_20_0.png">

</figure>




You can add a title to the plot too. Below you assign the plot element to a variable called ax.
You then add a title to the plot using `ax.set_title()`.

{:.input}
```python
# Plot the data adjusting marker size and colors
# # 'col' sets point symbol color
# quickly plot the data adding a legend
ax = sjer_plot_locations.plot(column='plot_type', 
                         categorical=True, 
                         legend=True, 
                         figsize=(10,10),
                         markersize=45, 
                         cmap="Set2")
# add a title to the plot
ax.set_title('SJER Plot Locations\nMadera County, CA', fontsize=16);
```

{:.output}
{:.display_data}

<figure>

### Change Plot Colors & Symbols

You can use the cmap argument to adjust the colors of our plot. Below you used a colormap that is a part of the <a href="http://matplotlib.org/users/colormaps.html" target="_blank">matplotlib colormap library.</a>

Finally you use the **marker=** argument to specify the marker style.

{:.input}
```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize = (10,10))

sjer_plot_locations.plot(column='plot_type',
                              categorical=True,
                              legend=True,
                              marker='*', 
                              markersize=65, 
                              cmap='OrRd', ax=ax)
# add a title to the plot
ax.set_title('SJER Plot Locations\nMadera County, CA',
            fontsize=16);
```

{:.output}
{:.display_data}

<figure>

</figure>




{:.input}
```python
ax = sjer_plot_locations.plot(figsize=(10, 10), 
                              column='plot_type',
                              categorical=True,
                              marker='*', 
                              markersize=65, 
                              cmap='OrRd')
# add a title to the plot
ax.set_title('SJER Plot Locations\nMadera County, CA',
            fontsize = 16);
```

## Plot Shapefiles Using matplotlib and geopandas

Above you saw how to quickly plot shapefiles using geopandas plotting. The geopandas plotting is a great option for quickly exploring your data. However it is less customizable than `matplotlib` plotting. Below you will learn how to  create the same map using `matplotlib` to setup the axes. 

To plot with `matplotlib` you first setup the axes. Below you define the figuresize and marker size in the ax argument. 
You can adjust the symbol size of our plot using the `markersize` argument.
You can add a title using `ax.set_title()`.

You can create a larger map by adjusting the `figsize` argument. Below you set it to 10 x 10. 

<div class="notice--warning" markdown="1">


## <i class="fa fa-pencil-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> Test your knowledge: Import Line & Polygon Shapefiles

Using the steps above, import the `data/spatial-vector-lidar/california/madera-county-roads/tl_2013_06039_roads.shp`
and `data/spatial-vector-lidar/california/neon-sjer-site/vector_data/SJER_crop.shp` shapefiles into `Python`. Call the roads object `sjer_roads` and the crop layer `sjer_crop_extent`.

Answer the following questions:

1. What type of `Python` spatial object is created when you import each layer?
2. What is the `CRS` and `extent` for each object?
3. Do the files contain, points, lines or polygons?
4. How many spatial objects are in each file?

</div>



## Plot Multiple Shapefiles
You can plot several layers on top of each other using the geopandas `.plot` method too. To do this, you:

1. define the `ax` variable just as you did above to add a title to our plot. 
2. then you add as many layers to the plot as you want using geopandas `.plot()` method.

Notice below 

`ax.set_axis_off()` is used to turn off the x and y axis and 

`plt.axis('equal')` is used to ensure the x and y axis are uniformly spaced. 


{:.input}
```python
# import crop boundary
sjer_crop_extent = gpd.read_file("data/spatial-vector-lidar/california/neon-sjer-site/vector_data/SJER_crop.shp")

```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize = (10, 10))

# first setup the plot using the crop_extent layer as the base layer 
sjer_crop_extent.plot(color='lightgrey',
                      edgecolor = 'black',
                      ax = ax,
                      alpha=.5)
# then add another layer using geopandas syntax .plot, and calling the ax variable as the axis argument
sjer_plot_locations.plot(ax=ax,

## Custom Legends with Geopandas -- Optional

While you will likely not get to this in our workshop, below is an example of further customizing your geopandas plot.

Currently there is not a perfect way to create a custom legend in Geopandas although that functionality is being considered. An alternative is to plot your data using loops and a dictionary that provides the various attributes that you want to apply to each point type. 

{:.input}
```python
# make it a bit nicer using a dictionary to assign colors and line widths
plot_attrs = {'grass': ['blue', '*'], 
               'soil': ['brown','o'],
               'trees': ['green','*']}

# plot the data
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize  = (12, 8))

# first setup the plot using the crop_extent layer as the base layer
