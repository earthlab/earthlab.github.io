## Set up a Conda Python Environment 

### Install the Earth Lab Conda Environment

Conda allows you to have different environments installed on your computer to access different versions of `Python` and different libraries. Sometimes libraries conflict which causes errors and packages not to work. 

To avoid conflicts, we created an environment called `earth-analytics-python` that contains all of the spatial libraries that you will need for the `Python` lessons on this website.

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip:**
For more information about conda environments, check out the <a href="https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/concepts/environments.html" target="_blank">documentation on conda environments</a>.  
{: .notice--success }

To install the `earth-analytics-python` environment, you will need to follow these steps: 

1. Fork and clone a Github repository from `https://github.com/earthlab/earth-analytics-python-env` to your `earth-analytics` directory. This repository contains a file called `environment.yml` that is needed for the installation.  (For instructions on forking/cloning repositories, see the section below on **Fork and Clone Github Repository**). 
2. Copy the `environment.yml` file into your `earth-analytics` directory using your file manager. You can also copy the file using `Bash` if you prefer (e.g. `cd earth-analytics-python-env`, then `cp environment.yml ..` to move the file up to the parent directory `earth-analytics`). 
3. Open the Terminal on your computer (e.g. Git Bash for Windows or Terminal on a Mac/Linux).
4. In the Terminal, navigate to the `earth-analytics` directory (e.g. `cd ~`, then `cd earth-analytics`).
5. Then, type in the Terminal: `conda env create -f environment.yml`
6. Once the environment has been successfully installed, **close and reopen your terminal before you activate the environment** to make sure that the changes have been implemented.

Note that it takes a bit of time to run this setup, as it needs to download and install each library, and that you need to have internet access for this to run! 

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip:**
The instructions above will only work if you run them in the directory where you placed the environment.yml file
{: .notice--success }

<i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Windows Users:** A reminder that the lessons on this website assume that you are using Git Bash as your primary terminal. 
{: .notice--success}

Once the environment is installed, **always make sure that the earth-analytics-python environment is activated** before doing work for lessons on this website. 

See the instructions further down on this page to **Activate a Conda Environment**. Once the environment is activated, the name of the activated environment will appear in parentheses on the left side of your terminal. 


### Fork and Clone Github Repository

This section provides the basic steps for forking a `Github` repository (i.e. copying an existing repository to your `Github` account) and for cloning a forked repository (i.e. downloading your forked repository locally to your computer). For a more detailed explanation of these steps, see the lesson on <a href="{{ site.url }}/courses/earth-analytics-bootcamp/get-started-with-open-science/get-files-from-github/">Get Files from Github.com.</a>

#### Fork a Repository on Github.com

You can `fork` an existing `Github` repository from the main `Github.com` page of the repository that you want to copy (example: `https://github.com/earthlab/earth-analytics-python-env`).

On the main `Github.com` page of the repository, you will see a button on the top right that says `Fork`. 

Click on the `Fork` button and select your `Github.com` account as the home of the forked repository.

</figure>


#### Clone a Repository to Local Computer 

To download your forked copy of the `earth-analytics-python-env` repository to your computer, open the Terminal and change directories to your `earth-analytics` directory (e.g. `cd ~`, then `cd  earth-analytics`).

Then, run the command `git clone` followed by the URL to your fork on `Github` (e.g. `https://github.com/your-username/earth-analytics-python-env`). Be sure to change `your-username` to your `Github` account username.  

```bash
cd ~
cd earth-analytics
git clone https://github.com/your-username/earth-analytics-python-env
```


### About the Conda Environment

### What is a YAML (.yml) File?

When you work with conda, you can create custom lists that tell conda where to install libraries from, and in what order. You can even specify a particular version. You write this list using  <a href="http://yaml.org/" target="_blank">YAML</a> (Yet Another Markup Language). This is an alternative to using `pip` to install `Python` packages.  

In previous steps, you used a custom .yml list to install all of the `Python` libraries that you will need to complete the `Python` lessons on this website. This .yml list is customized to install libraries from the repositories and in an order that minimizes conflicts. 

If you run into any issues installing the environment from the .yml, let us know! 

Next, explore your new conda environment. Hereâ€™s what part of the .yml file looks like:

```
name: earth-analytics-python
channels:
  - conda-forge
  - defaults

dependencies:
  - python=3.7
  - pip
  # Core scientific python
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
```

Notice at the top of the file there is the environment name. This file has a few key parts: 

1. Name: the name of the environment that you will call when you want to activate the environment. The name `earth-analytics-python` is defined in the environment.yml file.

2. Channels: this list identifies where packages will be installed from. There are many options including conda, conda-forge and pip. You will be predominately using conda-forge for the `earth-analytics-python` environment. 

3. Dependencies: Dependencies are all of the things that you need installed in order for the environment to be complete. In the example, `Python` version 3.7 is specified. The order in which the libraries should be installed is also specified. 


## Manage Your Conda Environment

You can have different `Python` environments on your computer. Conda allows you to easily jump between environments using a set of commands that you run in your terminal. 

### View a List of All Installed Conda Environments

You can see a list of all installed conda environments by typing:

```bash

conda info --envs

```

If you want to use a particular environment that you have installed on your computer, you need to activate it. 

For example, if a `Python` package such as `geopandas` is only installed in the `earth-analytics-python` environment, and not the default conda environment, you will not be able to access it (e.g. import it to `Jupyter Notebook`), unless you have the `earth-analytics-python` environment activated.


### Activate a Conda Environment

**To activate an environment**, use the Terminal to navigate to your earth-analytics directory (e.g. `cd` to the directory). Then, type the following command to activate the environment (e.g. `earth-analytics-python`):

```bash
conda activate earth-analytics-python
``` 

<a href="https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html" target="_blank">For older installations of conda (versions prior to 4.6)</a> on Mac, Linux, and Git Bash for Windows, type:

```bash
source activate earth-analytics-python
```
<i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Windows Users:** The first time that you try to run the "conda activate" command, you may be asked to configure Git Bash to use "conda activate". You can do this by running the command "conda init bash", just one time. After that, Git Bash will be configured to use "conda activate" moving forward.  
{: .notice--success}

Once the environment is activated, the name of the activated environment will appear in parentheses on the left side of your terminal. 

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip:**
Note that after you restart the Terminal, the earth-analytics-python environment is no longer active. You will need to activate the earth-analytics-python environment each time you start the Terminal by running the appropriate command provided above for your operating system. 
{: .notice--success}


### Deactivate a Conda Environment 

If needed, you can deactivate a conda environment. Deactivating the environment switches you back to the default environment in your computer. 

```bash
conda deactivate

```

###  Delete a Conda Environment

If you ever want to delete an envrionment, you must first deactivate that environment and then type: 

```bash
conda env remove --name myenv
``` 

and replace `myenv` with the name of the environment that you want to remove. 

**Remember to never delete your root environment.**
