## <i class="fa fa-ship" aria-hidden="true"></i> Get Python, Git and Bash Setup On Your Computer

The lessons in this section will help you get your computer setup with core earth analytics tools that you will use in many of the lessons on this website. 

1. Bash: Bash comes with Mac and Linux but is not natively installed on windows. Bash is a powerful command line interface that allows you to efficiently manipulate files and directories. It is also how you will interact with git (version control). 
2. Git: Git is a tool that you use to keep track of changes in your documents. This makes your workflow more reproducible. It also allows you to undo changes that you want to undo! 
3. Anaconda - Anaconda is a python distribution that contains many of the scientific python packages that you will need to work with data. You will then install the earth-analytics-python environment on top of the Anaconda distribution so you can work with other scientific data including spatial data and more!
