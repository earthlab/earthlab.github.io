## Why Install Miniconda vs Anaconda

In the previous lesson, you learned that `Git` is a widely used tool for version control that allows you to track and manage changes to your files. `Git Bash` is used by Windows users to access both `Git` and `Bash` in one easy-to-install terminal. 

You also learned that the conda package manager allows you to install `Python` packages on your computer as well as create and manage multiple `Python` environments, each containing different packages. 

Although the conda package manager can be installed using either the Miniconda `Python` distribution or the Anaconda `Python` distribution, there are key differences between the two distributions:

|<a href="https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/" target = "_blank">Anaconda</a> | <a href="https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html" target = "_blank">Miniconda</a>|
|:--------|:---------|
|Installs a long, pre-configured list of Python packages (many of which may not be used)  | Only installs a basic Python environment |
|Installs Anaconda Navigator, Spyder, and many other tools that may not be needed | Only installs the conda package manager |
|Installation can take up a lot time and space on your computer | Installation is quick and minimal |

To limit the time and space needed for installation (and to minimize potential conflicts between packages),
you will use the Miniconda `Python` distribution to get started with only packages that you need to complete the `Python` lessons on this website. You can always add more `Python` packages as you need them!

If you already have Anaconda installed on your computer, you can still install Miniconda on your computer (see additional details in the Setup Miniconda section below). Installing Miniconda will help you avoid dependency issues or conflicts when setting up the `earth-analytics-python` conda environment that you need for the `Python` lessons on this website.   


## Bash Setup 

### Install Bash for Windows

Download the <a href="https://git-scm.com/download/win" target = "_blank">Git for Windows installer</a>. 

Run the installer by double-clicking on the downloaded file and by following the steps bellow:
1. Click on “Run”.
2. Click on "Next".
3. Click on "Next".
4. Click on "Next".
5. Click on "Next".
6. Click on "Next".
7. **Leave the selection on  "Git from the command line and also from 3rd party software"** and click on "Next". NOTE: If you forgot to do this, the programs that you need for the workshop will not work properly. If this happens, rerun the installer and select the appropriate option.
8. Click on "Next". 
9. **Leave the selection on  "Checkout Windows-style, commit Unix-style line endings"** and click on “Next”.
10. Select the second option for **Use Windows' default console window** and click on "Next".
11. Click on "Next".
12. Click on "Install".
13. When the install is complete, click on “Finish”.

This installation will provide you with both `Git` and `Bash` within the `Git Bash` program.

### Install Bash for Mac OS X

The default shell in all versions of Mac OS X is `Bash`, so no need to install anything. You access `Bash` from the Terminal (found in /Applications/Utilities). You may want to keep Terminal in your dock for this workshop.

### Install Bash for Linux

The default shell is usually `Bash` but if your machine is set up differently you can run it by opening the Terminal and typing: `bash`. There is no need to install anything.


## Git Setup

`Git` is a version control system that lets you track who made changes to what and when, and it has options for easily updating a shared or public version of your code on <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. 

You will need a <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/supported-browsers/" target="_blank">supported web browser</a> (current versions of Chrome, Firefox or Safari, or Internet Explorer version 9 or above).

`Git` installation instructions borrowed and modified from <a href="http://software-carpentry.org/" target="_blank">Software Carpentry</a>.

### Git for Windows

`Git` was installed on your computer as part of your `Bash` install.

### Git on Mac OS X

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LQhwETCdwY" target="_blank">Video Tutorial</a>

Install `Git` on Macs by downloading and running the most recent installer for "mavericks" if you are using OS X 10.9 and higher -or- if using an earlier OS X, choose the most recent "snow leopard" installer, from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/" target="_blank">this list</a>. 

After installing `Git`, there will not be anything in your /Applications folder, as `Git` is a command line program.


<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip:**
If you are running Mac OSX El Capitan, you might encounter errors when trying to use `Git`. Make sure you update XCODE. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32893412/command-line-tools-not-working-os-x-el-capitan" target="_blank">Read more - a Stack Overflow Issue</a>.

### Git on Linux

If `Git` is not already available on your machine, you can try to install it via your distro’s package manager. For Debian/Ubuntu, run `sudo apt-get install git` and for Fedora run `sudo yum install git`.


## Setup Miniconda 

You will use the Miniconda `Python` 3.x distribution to follow the `Python` lessons on this website. 

In <a href="{{ site.url }}/workshops/setup-earth-analytics-python/setup-python-anaconda-earth-analytics-environment/">lesson 4 of this module</a>, you will set up a custom conda environment with the `Python` packages that you need to complete lessons on this website.  

**Even if you already have Anaconda for `Python` 2.x or 3.x setup, you will still need to set-up Miniconda.** You can install Miniconda following the instructions listed below, even if you already have a full Anaconda installation. (Note for Windows Users: if you already have Anaconda 3.7, you will be asked to confirm that you want to make the Miniconda installation the default conda on your computer when you follow step 6 of the Miniconda installation. If you have questions or concerns about this, please contact your course instructor.) 

### Windows

**IMPORTANT:** if you already have a `Python` installation on your Windows computer, the settings below will replace it with Miniconda `Python 3.7` as the default `Python`. If you have questions or concerns about this, please contact your course instructor. 

Download the <a href="https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html" target="_blank">Miniconda installer for Windows</a>. Be sure to download the `Python` 3.7 version! 

Run the installer by double-clicking on the downloaded file and follow the steps below. 
1. Click “Run”. 
2. Click on "Next".
3. Click on “I agree”.
4. Leave the selection on “Just me” and click on “Next”.
5. Click on "Next".
6. **Select the first option for “Add Anaconda to my PATH environment variable”** and also **leave the selection on “Register Anaconda as my default Python 3.7”.** Click on “Install”.
    * Note that even though the installation is for Miniconda, the installer uses the word Anaconda in these options.
    * You will also see a message in red text that selecting “Add Anaconda to my PATH environment variable” is not recommended; continue with this selection to make using conda easier in Git Bash. If you have questions or concerns, please contact your instructor.
7. When the install is complete, Click on “Next”.
8. Click on “Finish”. 

### Mac

1. Download the installer: <a href="https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html" target="_blank">Miniconda installer for Mac</a>. Be sure to download the `Python` 3.x version!

2. In your Terminal window, run: `bash Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh`.

3. Follow the prompts on the installer screens.

4. If you are unsure about any setting, accept the defaults. You can change them later.

5. To make sure that the changes take effect, close and then re-open your Terminal window.


### Linux

1. Download the installer: <a href="https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html" target="_blank">Miniconda installer for Linux</a>. Be sure to download the `Python` 3.x version!

2. In your Terminal window, run: `bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh`.

3. Follow the prompts on the installer screens.

4. If you are unsure about any setting, accept the defaults. You can change them later. 

5. To make sure that the changes take effect, close and then re-open your Terminal window.
