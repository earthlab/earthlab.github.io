## <i class="fa fa-graduation-cap" aria-hidden="true"></i> Learning objectives
At the end of this activity, you will be able to:

* Create a new repository on GitHub
* `Clone` your repository to your local computer
* Modify files in your repository and track changes using commits with git
* Push your changes back to GitHub

## <i class="fa fa-check-square-o fa-2" aria-hidden="true"></i> What you need

* A GitHub user account
* A terminal running bash, and
* git installed and configured on your computer.

Follow the setup instructions here:
* [Setup instructions]({{ site.url }}/workshops/intro-version-control-git/)

</div>


## Create a new repository on GitHub

1. To begin, sign in to your user account on <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.
2. In the upper right corner, click the `+` sign icon, then choose **New repository**.
This will take you to a page where you can enter a repository name (this tutorial uses `test-repo` as the repository name), description, and choose to initialize with a README (a good idea!).
3. It is a good idea to add a `.gitignore` file by selecting one of the languages from the drop down menu, though for this tutorial it will not be necessary.
4. Similarly, in practice you should choose a license to that people know whether and how they can use your code.
5. Once you have entered a repository name and made your selection, select **Create repository**, and you will be taken to your new repository web page.

## Git at the command line

Below you will learn a series of commands that you can run at the command line
in git bash, terminal of whatever bash tool you are using. There are 2 types of
commands that you will use

1. **Bash commands:** These are commands that are native to bash / shell. They allow you to navigate around your computer, explore directory structures, create and manipulate files and directories, and more. (e.g. `ls`, `cd`, `mkdir`, etc)

2. **Git commands:** These are commands that are specific to git and will only be available if you have git installed on your computer. Git specific commands will always started with a call to git (e.g. `git status`, `git clone`, etc)


## Clone your repository to your local machine

Next, clone your newly created repository from GitHub to your local computer.
From your repository page on GitHub, click the green button labeled
**Clone or download**, and in the "Clone with HTTPs" section, copy the URL for
your repository.

Next, on your local machine, open your bash shell and change your current working
directory to the location where you would like to clone your repository. Note that
here we are using a bash command - `cd` (change directory).

For example, on a Unix based system, if you wanted to have your repository in your
`Documents` folder, you change directories as follows:


```bash
cd Documents
```

Once you have navigated to the directory where you want to put your repository,
you can use:

`git clone https://github.com/URL-TO-REPO-HERE`

The `git clone` command copies your repository from GitHub to your local computer.
Note that this is a git specific command.


```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
```

When you run `git clone repo-path-here`, You should see output like:

```
Cloning into 'test-repo'...
remote: Counting objects: 5, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (4/4), done.
remote: Total 5 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
Unpacking objects: 100% (5/5), done.
Checking connectivity... done.
```

Note: The repository name and output numbers that you see on your computer,
representing the total file size, etc, may differ from the example provided above.

To verify that your repository now exists locally, type `ls` in your terminal. The
ls command lists the files & folders available in your current directory. You should
see a directory with the same name as the repository that you created previously
on GitHub.

## Tracking changes with `git add` and `git commit`

Next use `cd` to **c**hange **d**irectories using the syntax:

`cd my-repo-name`

Replace my-repo-name with the folder name of your repo  (this should be your
repo name - e.g. 14ers-git)


```bash
cd test-repo
```

If you list all the files in this directory (using `ls -a`), you should see
all of the files that exist in your GitHub repository:


```bash
ls -a
```

```
.git  .gitignore  LICENSE  README.md
```

Alternatively, we can view the local repository in the finder (Mac), a Windows
Explorer (Windows) window, or GUI file browser (Linux).

Simply open your file browser and navigate to the new local repo.

<div class='notice--success' markdown="1">

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Important Tip** The `.git` element is listed when
you use the `ls -a` command shows up is actually a directory which will keep
track of your changes (the commits that you make) in git. **Warning:** Do not
edit the files in this directory manually!
</div>

Using either method, we can see that the file structure of our cloned repo
mirrors the file structure of our forked GitHub repo.

### Edit a file in your repo

Next, open up your favorite text editor and make a few edits to the
`README.md` file. Save your changes.

Once you are happy with your changes and have saved them, go back to your terminal
window and type `git status` and hit return to execute the command.


```bash
git status
```

```
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

	modified:   README.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

The output from `git status` indicates that you have modified the file `README.md`.
To keep track of this change to this file, you need to

1. `add` the changes, then
2. `commit` the changes.

### Add and commit changes

You will use the add and commit functions to add and commit changes that you make
to git.

* `git add`: takes a modified file in your working directory and places the modified version in a staging area.
* `git commit` takes everything from the staging area and makes a permanent snapshot of the current state of your repository that is associated with a unique identifier.


These two commands make up the bulk of many workflows that use git for version
control.

#### Add files

You can add an individual file or groups of files to git tracking. To add a
single file, use

`git add file-name-here-with-extension`

To add the README.md file that you just modified, you'd use:


```bash
git add README.md
```

To add ALL of the files that you have edited at the same time, you can use:



```bash
git add --all
```

Use `git add --all` with caution. You do not want to accidentally add things
like credential files, `.DS_Store` files, or history files.


#### Commit files

Once you are ready to make a snapshot of the current state of your repository,
you can use `git commit`. The git commit command requires a **commit message**
that describes the snapshot / changes that you made in that commit.

A commit message should outline what changed and why. These messages

1. help collaborators and your future self understand what was changed and why
2. allow you and your collaborators to find (and undo if necessary) changes that
were previously made.

If you are not committing a lot of changes, you can create a short one line
commit message using the `-m` flag:


```bash
git commit -m "Editing the README to try out git add/commit"
```

Alternatively, if you are committing many changes, or a small number of changes
that require explanation, you'll want to write a
<a href="http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html" target="_blank">detailed multi-line commit message</a> using a text editor.

If you have configured git to use your favorite text editor (via `git config --global core.editor your-fav-editor-here`), then you can open that editor to write your commit message
using the `git commit` command:


```bash
git commit
```

Once you save your commit message and exit the text editor, the file that you
created will contain your commit message.

<div class="notice--warning" markdown="1">

## <i class="fa fa-pencil-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> Challenge

Make changes to files in your git repo. These changes may includes

1. adding new files to the repo
2. adding content to the files (Text)
3. adding new directories to your repo


For each change, practice using

* `git add` to stage the change, and
* `git commit` to take a snapshot of your repository

After you've made a few commits, check out the output of the `git log` command.
You should see the history of your repository, including all of the commit messages!


```bash
git log
```

### Push changes to GitHub

So far we have only modified our local copy of the repository.
To add the changes to your git repo files on your computer to the version of your
repository on GitHub, you need to **push** them GitHub.

You can push your changes to GitHub with:


```bash
git push
```

You will then be prompted for your GitHub user name and password.
After you've pushed your commits, visit your repository on GitHub and notice
that your changes are reflected there, and also that you have access to the full
commit history for your repository!
