In this page, you will be introduced to the importance of version control in
scientific workflows.

## What is Version Control?

A version control system maintains a record of changes to code and other content.
It also allows us to revert changes to a previous point in time.

## Types of Version control

There are many forms of version control. Some not as good:

* Save a document with a new date (we’ve all done it, but it isn’t efficient)
* Google Docs "history" function (not bad for some documents, but limited in scope).

Some better:

* Git
* Mercurial
* Subversion


## Why Version Control is Important

Version control facilitates two important aspects of many scientific workflows:

1. The ability to save and review or revert to previous versions.
2. The ability to collaborate on a single project.

This means that you don’t have to worry about a collaborator (or your future self)
overwriting something important. It also allows two people working on the same
document to efficiently combine ideas and changes.

## How Version Control Systems Works

### Simple Version Control Model

A version control system tracks what has changed in one or more files over time.
Version control systems begin with a base version of a document. They then save
the committed changes that you make. You can think of version control as a tape:
if you rewind the tape and start at the base document, then you can play back
each change and end up with your latest version.

 <figure>

	<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/earth-analytics/git-version-control/git-play-changes.png" alt = "A version control system saves changes to a document, sequentially as you add and commit them to the system."></a>

	</figcaption>
</figure>

Once you think of changes as separate from the document itself, you can then
think about “playing back” different sets of changes onto the base document.
You can then retrieve, or revert to, different versions of the document.

Collaboration with version control allows to users to make independent changes
to the same document.

If there aren’t conflicts between the users' changes (a conflict is an area
where both users modified the same part of the same document in different
ways) you can review two sets of changes on the same base document.

	<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/earth-analytics/git-version-control/git-merge.png" ALT = "Two sets of changes to the same base document can be reviewed together, within a version control system if there are no conflicts (areas where both users modified the same part of the same document in different ways). Changes submitted by both users can then be merged together."></a>

A version control system is a tool that keeps track of these changes for us.
Each version of a file can be viewed and reverted to at any time. That way if you
add something that you end up not liking or delete something that you need, you
can simply go back to a previous version.

### Git & GitHub - A Distributed Version Control Model

Git uses a distributed version control model. This means that there can be many
copies (or forks/branches in GitHub world) of the repository. When working locally,
git is the program that you will use to keep track of changes to your repository.
GitHub is a location on the internet (a cloud web server) that acts as a remote
location for your repository. GitHub provides a backup of your work, that can be
retrieved if your local copy is lost (e.g., if your computer falls off a pier).

GitHub also allows you to share your work and collaborate with others on projects.
