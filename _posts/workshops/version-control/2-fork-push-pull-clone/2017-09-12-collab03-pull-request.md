## <i class="fa fa-graduation-cap" aria-hidden="true"></i> Learning objectives
At the end of this activity, you will be able to:

* Submit a pull request to a repo suggesting changes using github.com
* Define base fork vs. head fork

## <i class="fa fa-check-square-o fa-2" aria-hidden="true"></i> What you need

* A GitHub user account
* A terminal running bash, and
* Git installed and configured on your computer.

Follow the setup instructions here:
* [Setup instructions]({{ site.url }}/workshops/intro-version-control-git/)

</div>

You have now learned how to:

1. `Fork` a repo in someone else's github account to your github account
2. `Clone` this repo to your local computer
3. Edit copies of that cloned repo locally on your computer
4. `add`, `commit` those edits to your git repo locally
5. `Push` the committed edits back to your fork

In this lesson, you'll learn how to submit a **pull request** to suggest that your
edits are included in another (the central Earth Lab) repo.

## About pull requests

A pull request to another repo is similar to a "push". However it allows
for a few things:

1. It allows you to contribute to another repo without needing administrative
privileges to make changes to the repo.
2. It allows others to review your changes and suggest corrections, additions,
edits, etc..
3. It allows repo administrators control over what gets added to
their project repo.

The ability to suggest changes to ANY repo, without needing administrative
privileges is a powerful feature of GitHub. In our case, you do not have privileges
to make changes to the `earthlab/14ers-git` repo. However, you can make as many changes
as you want in your fork, and then suggest that Earth Lab incorporate those changes
into their repo, using a pull request.

## Pull requests in GitHub

*This section was adapted from
<a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/#pr" target="_blank"> the GitHub Hello World guide</a>.
They provide an animated version of these directions.*

Pull requests are the heart of collaboration on GitHub. When you
open a pull request, you’re proposing your changes and requesting that someone
review and pull in your contribution and merge them into their project.

Pull requests show diffs, (differences), of the content between your
repo and the repo that you are submitting changes to.
The changes, additions, and subtractions are shown in green and red.

#### Step 1 - Start Pull Request
To begin a pull request (PR), click the pull request button on the main repo page.

 <figure>
	<a href="{{ site.url }}/images/earth-analytics/git-version-control/github-submit-pull-request.png">
	<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/earth-analytics/git-version-control/github-submit-pull-request.png" alt="Location of the Pull Request button on the earthLab/14ers-git repo."></a>
	<figcaption> Location of the Pull Request button on the earthLab/14ers-git repo.
	</figcaption>
</figure>


<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip:** You can also click the "Pull requests" tab
at the top of the page to submit a pull request. When the pull request page opens,
click the "New pull request" button to initiate the PR.
{: .notice}


#### Step 2 - Which repo to update - select your base & head

Next you need to select which repo you wish to update (the base repo) and which
repo contains the content that you wish to use to update the base (the head repo).
In this example, you want to update **earthLab/14ers-git** with commits in your fork
**YOUR-USERNAME/14ers-git**.

**Head vs Base**

* **Base:** the repo that will be updated, the changes will be added to this repo.
* **Head:** the repo from which the changes come.

One way to remember this is that the “head” is a*head* of the base. So
we must add from the head to the base.

When you begin a pull request, the head and base will auto-populate as follows:

* base fork: **earthlab/14ers-git**
* head fork: **YOUR-USERNAME/14ers-git**

The above pull request configuration tells Git to update the Earth Lab repo
with contents **from your repo**.

#### Step 3 - Verify changes

When you compare two repos in a pull request page, GitHub provides an overview
of the differences (diffs) between the files. Look over the changes and make sure
nothing looks surprising.

	<a href="{{ site.url }}/images/earth-analytics/git-version-control/github-pull-request-diff.png">
	<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/earth-analytics/git-version-control/github-pull-request-diff.png" alt="Location of the Pull Request button on the earthLab/14ers-git repo."></a>
	<figcaption> This screenshot shows the differences between the files on Earth Lab's
  version of the 14ers repo in red and your copy of the repo in green.
  Deletions are highlighted in red and additions
	are highlighted in green.
	Pull request diffs view can be changed between unified and split (arrow).
	</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Step 4 - Create a pull request

If you are adding new commits to the Earth Lab repo, then the pull request button will be available.
Click the green "Create Pull Request" button to submit your pull request.

#### Step 5 - Describe your pull request using a short title

Give your pull request a title and write a brief description of your changes.
When you’re done with your message, click "Create Pull Request".

Notice the repo name up at the top (in your repo and in screenshot above)
When creating the pull request you will be automatically transferred to the base
repo. Since your fork was the base (we are updating it), GitHub will transfer
<!-- The text above says that the earthlab repo is the base fork - is this wrong? -->
you to your github.com fork landing page.

<div class="notice--warning" markdown="1">

## <i class="fa fa-pencil-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> Challenge - Submit Pull Request to update a 14er markdown file

Within the 14er repo, you will find a list of `.md` - one for some of the tallest
14ers in Colorado.

On your computer, do the following

1. Select a 14er markdown file that you'd like to update.
2. Look up the elevation and location (longitude, latitude in decimal degrees) for the 14er
3. Add that information and an interesting fact or so about the 14er to the appropriate 14er markdown file.

Next

1. Save your file, add and commit your changes and then push the changes to your fork on GitHub.
2. Submit a pull request to the `earthLab/14ers-git` repo.

HINT:

* base fork: **earthlab/14ers-git**
* head fork: **YOUR-USER-NAME/14ers-git**

* Finally, go to the Earth Lab 14ers repo on GitHub. Look for the "Pull Requests"
link at the top of the page. How many pull requests are there?
* Do you see your pull request?


</div>



<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip:** While you can submit a pull request to
any (public) repo on GitHub, you can only merge a PR if you own the repo or
have appropriate permissions. You don’t have contributor permissions to the Earth Lab
repo. Thus the workshop instructors will merge the pull requests as they are submitted
during the workshop.

## Workflow summary

### Syncing repos with pull requests

On GitHub:

* Fork the earthlab/14ers-git repo to your GitHub account.

On your computer:

* Clone the repo to your computer locally (you'll only do this once)
* Edit any files that you wish to change
  + `add` and `commit` your changes to your repository
  + `git push` your changes up to your fork on GitHub

On GitHub:

+ Button: Create New Pull Request
+ Set base: earthlab/14ers-git, set head: your fork
+ Make sure changes are what you want to sync
+ Button: Create Pull Request
+ Describe the Pull Request using a succinct title & descriptive comments
+ Button: Create Pull Request

Remember that you can only merge the pull request if you have contributor permissions to the repo!


<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip:**
Are you a Windows user and are having a hard time copying the URL into shell?
You can copy and paste in the shell environment **after** you
have the feature turned on. Right click on your bash shell window (at the top)
and select "properties". Make sure "quick edit" is checked. You should now be
able to copy and paste within the bash environment.

### What's A Merge Conflict?

A merge conflict
occurs when two users edit the same part of a file at the same time. Git cannot
automatically determine which edit should be in the most current copy. Hence the conflict.
