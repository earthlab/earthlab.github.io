## The Scenario

You are in a lab and a colleague has moved on to a new job and left you their
research which you are tasked by your supervisor with picking up and moving forward.
Have a look at the files that were left for you to work with and answer the following
questions:

1. Are the contents of the directory easy to understand?
2. Do you feel confident that you can easily recreate the workflow associated with the data / code?
3. Do you have access to the data? What data are available and where / how were
they collected?

Next, work with your group to document ways in which you could improve upon the
reproducibility of this project.

1. Create a list of things that would make the working directory easier to work with.
1. Break that list into general “areas” / categories of reproducibility.
