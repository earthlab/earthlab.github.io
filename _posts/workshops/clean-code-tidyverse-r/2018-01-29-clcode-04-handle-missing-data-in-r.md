At the end of this activity, you will be able to:

* Understand why it is important to make note of missing data values.
* Be able to define what a NA value is in `R` and how it is used in a vector.

In the previous lesson you attempted to plot the first file's worth of data
by time. However, the plot did you turn out as planned. There were
at least two values that likely represent missing data values:

* `missing` and
* `999.99`

In this lesson, you will learn how to handle missing data values in `R` using
`readr` and some basic data exploration approaches.

## Missing Data Values

Sometimes, your data are missing values. Imagine a spreadsheet in Microsoft
Excel with cells that are blank. If the cells are blank, you don’t know for
sure whether those data weren’t collected, or someone forgot to fill them in.
To indicate that data are missing (not by mistake) you can put a value in
those cells that represents no data.

The `R` programming language uses `NA` to represent missing data values.

Lucky for us, `readr` makes it easy to deal with missing data values too.
To account for these, we use the argument:

`na = "value_to_change_to_na_here"`

You can also send na a vector of missing data values, like this:
`na = c("value1", "value2")`


```r
# load libraries
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
```

Let's go through our workflow again but this time account for missing values.
First, let's have a look at the unique values contained in our `HPCP` column


```r
# import data using readr
all_paths <- read_csv("data/data_urls.csv")
# grab first url from the file
first_csv <- all_paths$url[1]

# open data
year_one <- read_csv(first_csv)
# view unique vales in HPCP field
unique(year_one$HPCP)
## [1] "0"       "0.2"     "0.1"     "999.99"  "missing" "0.3"     "0.9"    
## [8] "0.5"
```

Next, we can create a vector of missing data values. We can see that we have
999.99 and missing as possible `NA` values.


```r
# define all missing data values in a vector
na_values <- c("missing", "999.99")

# use the na argument to read in the csv
year_one <- read_csv(first_csv,
                     na = na_values)
unique(year_one$HPCP)
## [1] 0.0 0.2 0.1  NA 0.3 0.9 0.5
```

Once you have specified possible missing data values, try to plot again.


```r
year_one %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = DATE, y = HPCP)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(x = "Date",
       y = "Precipitation",
       title = "Precipitation Over Time")
```

Note that when `ggplot` encounters missing data values, it tells you with
a warning message:

```r
Warning message:
Removed 3 rows containing missing values (geom_point).
```

The `mutate()` function allows you to add a new column to a `data.frame`.
And the `month()` function in the `lubridate` package, will convert a `datetime`
object to a month value (1-12) as follows

`mutate(the_month = month(date_field_here))`

Create a plot that summarizes total precipitation by month for the first csv
file that we have worked with through this lesson. Use everything that you
have learned so far to do this.

Your final plot should look like the one below:

<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/workshops//clean-code-tidyverse-r/2018-01-29-clcode-04-handle-missing-data-in-r/plot-by-month-1.png" title="plot of chunk plot-by-month" alt="plot of chunk plot-by-month" width="90%" />

HINTS:

The bar plot was created using the following ggplot elements:

`geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "darkorchid4") + theme_bw()`
