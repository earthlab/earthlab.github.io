Earth analytics, also known as Earth data science, is a field that uses data
science techniques to study Earth processes and solve environmental issues. This
rapidly growing field requires a mastery of both Earth science and data science,
a combination highly sought after in academia and industry. Read on to uncover
what it takes, according to hiring managers, to work in Earth data science.

## A Data-Driven World
Data are tied to everything that you do. From posting on social media to buying
groceries at the store, data are used to capture your actions. Remote sensing
data, collected by drones, airplanes and satellites, help us better understand
the Earth. Advances in remote sensing technology in recent years have provided
enormous opportunity for business applications and furthering human knowledge of
Earth systems.


## Career Opportunities in Data Science Continue to Grow
There has been an explosion of careers in the realms of <a href="https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century" target="_blank">
data science, big data and data analytics </a>. These fields require knowing how
to work with different data types using various methods, including scientific
programming and coding. In Glassdoor's <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/List/Best-Jobs-in-America-LST_KQ0,20.htm" target="_blank"> 2016 and 2017 Best Jobs in America </a> surveys, "data scientist"
ranked number one, based on number of job openings, salary and overall job
satisfaction rating. The demand for data scientists continues to increase.

Data science skills are increasingly required in scientific career tracks. Yet,
data science is advancing so quickly that professionals and universities are
struggling to keep up.

## There Are Not Enough Data Scientists to Meet Demand
As the demand for data science skills increases, there is a deficit in the supply
of these unique skills in the job market. According to the McKinsey Global
Institute's <a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-analytics/our-insights/the-age-of-analytics-competing-in-a-data-driven-world" target="_blank"> The Age of Analytics: Competing in a Data-Driven World report</a>,
the U.S. will experience a shortage of 250,000 employees trained in data skills
by 2024. Employers are responding by increasing salaries. The average wages for
data scientists in the U.S. rose by about 16 percent per year from 2012 to 2014,
compared to <a href="http://offers.indeed.com/rs/699-SXJ-715/images/US-Beyond-the-Talent-Shortage.pdf" target="_blank"> 2 percent across all occupations </a>.

## Earth Analytics: A New Frontier
Earth analytics is a cutting edge field that combines knowledge of Earth sciences
with data science skills to study environmental processes, address technological
challenges associated with collecting and analyzing data, develop new data
collection methods and more.

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> The increasing availability of data coincides with an increase in job opportunities that require the use, management and understanding of scientific data. As a result, Earth analytics is a growing niche.

Earth systems data can be combined with demographic, social and behavioral data
in new and creative ways to understand how humans interact with and impact their
environment. Understanding these changes and interactions is critical to:

* Scientific efforts to address important environmental issues
* Industry efforts to build new and innovative tools

## Earth Scientists Need Data Science Skills
Some of the data scientist shortage can be attributed to a need for professionals
who have both technical data skills and knowledge in a specific discipline. The
demand for these coupled skills has led to an explosion in business analytics and
health analytics master's degree programs. Earth analytics skills are equally
critical to today's society and economy.

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> The nexus of data science and Earth science is so cutting edge that <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/earthlab/earth-analytics-education" target="_blank"> only a handful of advanced programs </a> teach these skillsets together.
{: .notice--success}

For example, in scientific efforts to better predict forest fires, understanding
how to analyze remote sensing data and create maps is just as important as scientific
knowledge of Earth systems and landscape ecology. This highly sought after marriage
of skillsets make Earth analytics experts uniquely qualified to fulfill the demands
of this fledgling field.

## Seeking Interdisciplinary and Collaborative Professionals
In addition to possessing data science skills, successful scientists today need
to be able to collaborate on interdisciplinary teams. Science questions are bigger
and broader than ever before, requiring more knowledge across more disciplines to
find answers. This trend may be seen through the increase in authors in research
publications.

The average number of authors on research papers <a href="https://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21710792-scientific-publications-are-getting-more-and-more-names-attached-them-why" target="_blank"> has grown from 3.2 to 4.4</a> between 1996 and 2016. One <a href="https://www.nature.com/news/physics-paper-sets-record-with-more-than-5-000-authors-1.17567" target="_blank"> research paper on the Large Hadron Collider</a> had more than 5,000 authors.

A similar demand for interdisciplinary skills is seen in the private sector. Most
real-world project scenarios involve working across disciplines and in teams,
requiring flexible individuals who can adapt, communicate remotely and in-person,
and collaborate.

Yes, it's a tall order to have interdisciplinary expertise, know how to code,
understand open science methods and work well with others. Fulfilling this order
will also make you a hot commodity in the workforce and in some of the most
reputable businesses and institutions today.
