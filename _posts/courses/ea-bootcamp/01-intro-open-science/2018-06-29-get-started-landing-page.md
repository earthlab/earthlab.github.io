## <i class="fa fa-ship" aria-hidden="true"></i> Welcome to Week {{ page.week }}!

Welcome to Week {{ page.week }} of the Earth Analytics Bootcamp course! This week, you will learn about open reproducible science and get familiar with a suite of open source tools that are used in open reproducible science workflows including `Shell`, `Git` and `Github.com`, `Python`, and `Jupyter Notebook`. You will use `Shell` to access directories, `Git` and `Github.com` to copy files to your computer, and `Jupyter Notebook` to run `Python` code and render `Markdown` text.


## <i class="fa fa-graduation-cap" aria-hidden="true"></i> Learning Objectives

After completing the lessons for this week, you will be able to:

* Define open reproducible science and explain how the tools used in this course support and promote it
* Navigate, create, and delete directories in `Shell`
* Create a copy of (i.e. `fork`) other users' files on `Github.com` 
* Use the `Git clone` command to download the copy of files to your computer 
* Run `Python` code and render `Markdown` text in `Jupyter Notebook`
