## <i class="fa fa-graduation-cap" aria-hidden="true"></i> Learning Objectives

After completing this tutorial, you will be able to:

* Describe the difference between additive and subtractive light models.
* Explain how RGB images are rendered in a computer monitor.

You don't need anything for this lesson. Please watch the videos below. They
review what you learned in class with the additive light demo.

The ~1 minute video below inspired the demonstration that you saw in class.

The 2:30 minute video below shows the difference between additive and subtractive
light models and demonstrates subtractive models with paints.

The ~3 minute video below has no sound, but look closely as they zoom in on the pixels of
an old school computer monitor. You will notice that each  pixel is composed of three
types of light red, green and blue.
