## <i class="fa fa-ship" aria-hidden="true"></i> Welcome to Week {{ page.week }}!

Welcome to week {{ page.week }} of Earth Analytics! This week, you will explore
the concept of uncertainty surrounding lidar raster data (and remote sensing
data in general). You will use the same data that you downloaded last week for class.

For your homework you'll also need to download the data below. You can do this most easily `using earthpy.get_data()`.
