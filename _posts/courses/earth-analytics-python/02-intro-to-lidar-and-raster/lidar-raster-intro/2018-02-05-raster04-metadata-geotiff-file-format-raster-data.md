title: "About the Geotiff (.tif) Raster File Format: Raster Data in Python"
excerpt: "This lesson introduces the geotiff file format. Further it introduces the
concept of metadata - or data about the data. Metadata describe key characteristics of a data set. For spatial data these characteristics including CRS, resolution and spatial extent. Here you learn about the use of tif tags or metadata embedded within a geotiff file as they can be used to explore data programatically."

## What is a GeoTIFF?

A GeoTIFF is a standard `.tif` or image file format that includes additional spatial
(georeferencing) information embedded in the .tif file as tags. These embedded
tags are called `tif tags`. These tags can include the following raster metadata:

1. **Spatial Extent:** What area does this dataset cover?
2. **Coordinate reference system:** What spatial projection / coordinate reference
system is used to store the data? Will it line up with other data?
3. **Resolution:** The data appears to be in **raster** format. This means it is
composed of pixels. What area on the ground does each pixel cover - i.e. What is
its spatial resolution?
4. **`nodata` value**
5. How many layers are in the .tif file. (more on that later)

You discussed spatial extent and resolution in the previous lesson. When you work with
geotiffs the spatial information that describes the raster data are embedded within
the file itself.

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip:**  Your camera uses embedded tags to store
information about pictures that you take including the camera make and model,
and the time the image was taken.

### Geotiffs in Python

The `rasterio` package in `Python` allows us to both open geotiff files and also to
directly access `.tif tags`
programmatically. You can quickly view the spatial **extent**,
**coordinate reference system** and **resolution** of your raster data.

NOTE: not all geotiffs contain tif tags!

{:.input}
```python
# Import all packages in their own cell at the top of your notebook
import os
import rasterio as rio
import earthpy as et
# Get data and set wd
et.data.get_data("colorado-flood")
os.chdir(os.path.join(et.io.HOME, 'earth-analytics'))
```

Next let's open up a raster file in geotiff format (.tif). 

{:.input}
```python
with rio.open('data/colorado-flood/spatial/boulder-leehill-rd/pre-flood/lidar/pre_DTM.tif') as lidar_dem:
    lidar_dem.bounds
```

You can view spatial attibutes associated with the raster file too. Below you explore viewing a general list of attributes and then specific attributes including number of bands and horizontal (x, y) resolution.

{:.input}
```python
# View generate metadata associated with the raster file
lidar_dem.meta
```

{:.output}
{:.execute_result}



    {'driver': 'GTiff',
     'dtype': 'float32',
     'nodata': -3.4028234663852886e+38,
     'width': 4000,
     'height': 2000,
     'count': 1,
     'crs': CRS.from_epsg(32613),
     'transform': Affine(1.0, 0.0, 472000.0,
            0.0, -1.0, 4436000.0)}





{:.input}
```python
# What is the spatial resolution?
lidar_dem.res
```

{:.output}
{:.execute_result}



    (1.0, 1.0)





You can access the tif tags as well. 

{:.input}
```python
# View image structure
with rio.open('data/colorado-flood/spatial/boulder-leehill-rd/pre-flood/lidar/pre_DTM.tif') as lidar_dem:
    print(lidar_dem.tags(ns='IMAGE_STRUCTURE'))
    lidar_dem_mask = lidar_dem.dataset_mask()
```

{:.output}
    {'COMPRESSION': 'LZW', 'INTERLEAVE': 'BAND'}



### Raster Masks

You can view the mask associated with the data too. Here values that `=0` are `nodata` values whereas `= 255` are usable data values. 

{:.input}
```python
# View data mask
lidar_dem_mask
```

{:.output}
{:.execute_result}



    array([[  0,   0,   0, ..., 255, 255, 255],
           [  0,   0,   0, ..., 255, 255, 255],
           [  0,   0,   0, ..., 255, 255, 255],
           ...,
           [  0,   0,   0, ..., 255, 255, 255],
           [  0,   0,   0, ..., 255, 255, 255],
           [  0,   0,   0, ..., 255, 255, 255]], dtype=uint8)






<i class = "fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip:** Read more about attributes associated with rasterio objects and how they map to gdal objects.
{: .notice--success }

The information returned from the various attributes called above includes:

* x and y resolution
* projection
* data format (in this case your data are stored in float format which means they contain decimals)

and more.

You can also extract or view individual metadata attributes.


{:.input}
```python
print(lidar_dem.crs)
print(lidar_dem.bounds)
```

{:.output}
    EPSG:32613
    BoundingBox(left=472000.0, bottom=4434000.0, right=476000.0, top=4436000.0)



If you extract metadata from your data, you can then perform tests on the data as you process it. For instance, you can ask the question: 

* Do both datasets have the same spatial extent?

Find out the answer to this question this using `Python`.

{:.input}
```python
# Open lidar dsm
with rio.open("data/colorado-flood/spatial/boulder-leehill-rd/pre-flood/lidar/pre_DSM.tif") as lidar_dsm:
    extent_lidar_dsm = lidar_dsm.bounds 
```

{:.input}
```python
if lidar_dem.bounds == lidar_dsm.bounds:
    print("Both datasets cover the same spatial extent")
```

{:.output}
    Both datasets cover the same spatial extent



How about resolution? Do both datasets have the same horizontal (x and y) resolution?

{:.input}
```python
# Do both layers have the same spatial resolution?
lidar_dsm.res == lidar_dem.res
```

{:.output}
{:.execute_result}



    True





### Extra Metadata with EPSG
EPSG is short-hand way of specifying many CRS parameters at once. Each EPSG code correspondings to a Proj4 code. In `rasterio`, more metadata is available if you use Proj4 instead of EPSG. To see the Proj4 parameters for a given EPSG code, you can either [look them up online](http://www.spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/32613/) or use the EPSG to Proj4 dictionary:

{:.input}
```python
# Get crs of a rasterio object
lidar_dem.crs.data
```

{:.output}
{:.execute_result}



    {'init': 'epsg:32613'}





You can use the `earthpy et.epsg` lookup to get the proj4 string for an epsg code too.
Earthpy is a python package build for you by your instructors. We are working on better documentation for it
but for the time being you will find snippets of how to use it here. 

{:.input}
```python
et.epsg['32613']
```

{:.output}
{:.execute_result}



    '+proj=utm +zone=13 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs'





## Single Layer (or Band) vs Multi-Layer (Band Geotiffs)

You will learn more about multi vs single band imagery when you work with RGB (color) imagery in later weeks
of this course. However geotiffs can also store more than one band or layer. You
can see if a raster object has more than one layer using the `.count()` function
in `Python`.

{:.input}
```python
print(lidar_dem.count)
```

{:.output}
    1



Another way to see the number of bands is to use the .indexes attribute.

{:.input}
```python
# How many bands / layers does the object have?
print("number of bands", lidar_dem.indexes)
```

{:.output}
    number of bands (1,)
