## About the Earth Analytics Python Course
Earth analytics is an intermediate, multidisciplinary course that addresses major
questions in Earth science and teaches students to use the analytical tools
necessary to undertake exploration of heterogeneous ‘big scientific data’. This
course is designed for graduate students
and students participating in the <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/earthlab/earth-data-analytics-foundations-professional-certificate" target = "_blank">Earth Data Analytics Professional Certificate.</a>

### Course Overview 
Throughout the course we will use computationally intensive techniques to address
scientific questions. We will use a suite of different types of publicly available
data including:

* Satellite and airborne lidar and spectral remote sensing data,
* Data collected using distributed in situ (on the ground) sensor networks
* Social media data, and
* Basic demographic data.

This course is technical. We will use the `Python` scientific programming
environment and the `Jupyter` graphical interface to work with data.
