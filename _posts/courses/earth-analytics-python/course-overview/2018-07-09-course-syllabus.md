## Course Overview

This multidisciplinary course will address major questions in Earth science and 
teach students to use the analytical tools necessary to undertake exploration of 
heterogeneous 'big scientific data.' This course is designed for upper level (junior /
senior level) undergraduate students and graduate students.

Throughout the course you will use computationally intensive techniques to address
scientific questions. You will use a suite of different types of publicly available 
data including:

* Satellite and airborne lidar and spectral remote sensing data.
* Data collected using distributed *in situ* (on the ground) sensor networks.
* Social media data.

This course is technical. You will use the `Python` scientific programming
environment and the `Jupyter Notebook` interface to work with data. You will code every week!

## Grading
All grading for this course will follow the CU grading policies.
**Late assignments are not be accepted in this course.** If there are extenuating /
university approved circumstances university-approved activity, illness, injury,
family emergency, or religious observance that prevents you from completing an
assignment on time, please get in touch with the instructor or the course TA as
soon as possible and accommodations will be made for you to turn in your assignment
within a reasonable time period.

Course grades will be calculated using the following assignments:

| Assignment                      | Percent of Credit |  |  |  |
|:--------------------------------|:------------------|:-|:-|:-|
| Homework / Assignments          | 45%               |  |  |  |
| Mid term project                | 15%               |  |  |  |
| Final group presentation        | 10%               |  |  |  |
| Final individual project report | 20%               |  |  |  |

## Communication

All email messages about this course should include “earth-analytics” in the
subject line and be signed with your full name. Please use your official
**CU email address** when communicating with your course instructors.

If your email is not personal in nature, but rather a question about the homework,
issues with the course website, or issues with R, please

1. See if the question has already been asked in the Canvas Discussion page. 
2. If the question hasn't already been asked, please **post your question to the Canvas Discussion page**.


## Canvas Discussion Post Rules

It is important that you follow the course guidelines when posting to Canvas.

Do:

* Post questions that you have about homework assignments
* Post issues that you find with the website -- typos, errors, points of confusion
* Answer other questions if you can (you will receive participation points for posting in the Canvas Discussion page so use it)
* **upvote** questions that you have as well or that you think are written well
* Be respectful of your peers. All questions related to data and earth analytics are good questions.

Do not:

* Post any content that is in any way offensive or that violates University codes of conduct (see links below)
* Post explicit solutions to homework assignments (help each other out but don't post the answer)
* Post an entire `.ipynb` document on the Canvas Discussion page - rather post a small snippet of code that is causing problems and the associated code error

When posting questions about coding issues to the Canvas Discussion page, please do your best to
provide an example of the specific code error that you are encountering.

Example. The code

`read.csv("filename")`

returns this error:

`error here`

In the example above the fix would be to make sure your function name is correct.

## Assignments & Week to Week Communication

All assignments and week to week items will be communicated through Canvas - our course learning management system. Please canvas daily for assignment and
content updates. Turn on notifications if you don't login to canvas regularly. 

## Course Policies

### Attendance

Attendance is encouraged for all class sessions. I have found that students
who attend class often do better than those who don't. However, with that
said the entire course is available in an online format and you will be able
to participate in many activities remotely using the Canvas Discussion page.

### Participation

Course participation will be evaluated as a part of this course. Your course
participation grade is calculated using a combination of

1. Answering questions posted by students in the Canvas Discussions
2. Participation in discussions and group work in class
3. Identifying issues with the course website and posting them on Canvas 

### Classroom Behavior

Students and faculty each have responsibility for maintaining an appropriate
learning environment. Those who fail to adhere to such behavioral standards may
be subject to discipline. Professional courtesy and sensitivity are especially
important with respect to individuals and topics dealing with differences of
race, color, culture, religion, creed, politics, veteran’s status, sexual
orientation, gender, gender identity and gender expression, age, disability,
and nationalities. Class rosters are provided to the instructor with the
student's legal name. I will gladly honor your request to address you by
an alternate name or gender pronoun. Please advise the course instructor of this
preference early in the semester so that they can make appropriate changes to their
records. Please also see the policies for <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/policies/student-classroom-and-course-related-behavior" target="_blank">Student Classroom and Course-Related Behavior </a>and the
<a href="http://www.colorado.edu/policies/student-honor-code-policy" target="_blank">Student Honor Code.</a>

Community Engagement, to secure necessary academic accommodations. Please Note:
You are under no obligation to disclose your disability.

If you qualify for accommodations because of a disability, please submit to your
professor a letter from Disability Services in a timely manner (for exam
accommodations provide your letter at least one week prior to the exam) so that
your needs can be addressed. Disability Services determines accommodations based
on documented disabilities. Contact Disability Services at 303-492-8671 or by
e-mail at dsinfo@colorado.edu. If you have a temporary medical condition or injury,
see Temporary Medical Conditions: Injuries, Surgeries, and Illnesses guidelines

## Course Components

### Homework Assignments

Each week there will be a homework assignment. Use the materials on the website
including readings, tutorials and links to other resources in addition to skills
and concepts that you learn in class to complete the assignment.

### Weekly Readings

Readings are posted every week along with the homework assignment for that week.
The material for each week will be posted no later than the Tuesday before the
