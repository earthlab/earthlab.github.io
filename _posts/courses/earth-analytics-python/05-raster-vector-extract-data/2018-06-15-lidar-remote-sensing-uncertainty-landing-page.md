## <i class="fa fa-ship" aria-hidden="true"></i> Welcome to Week {{ page.week }}!

Welcome to week {{ page.week }} of Earth Analytics! This week, you will explore
the concept of uncertainty surrounding lidar raster data (and remote sensing
data in general). You will use the same data that you downloaded last week for class.
You will also use pipes again this week to work with tabular data.

For your homework you'll also need to download the data below.

## Example Homework Plots

The plots below are examples of what your plot could look like. Feel free to
customize or modify plot settings as you see fit!

### Calculated Regression Fit 

The above plots show the regression fit as calculated by the `seaborn` python package. Use `stats.linregression()` to calculate the slope and intercept of the regresion fit for each of the plots above. 

Print the outputs below.
