## <i class="fa fa-ship" aria-hidden="true"></i> Time series lessons are now in the intro textbook!

We have moved all of the time series lessons into our <a href="https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/use-data-open-source-python/use-time-series-data-in-python/">Intermediate earth data science textbook</a>. 

The course overview page will soon be moved into our earth analytics bootcamp course. Please check back for the new course landing page in the Fall of 2020! For the time being you can still read all of the lessons in the textbook above!
