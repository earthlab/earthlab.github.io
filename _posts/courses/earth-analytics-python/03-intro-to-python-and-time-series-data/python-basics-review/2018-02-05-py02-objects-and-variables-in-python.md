## <i class="fa fa-graduation-cap" aria-hidden="true"></i> Learning Objectives
At the end of this activity, you will be able to:

* Be able to create, modify and use objects or variables in `Python`.
* Be able to define the key differences between the str (string) and num (number) classes in `Python` in terms of how `python` can or can not perform calculations with each.

## <i class="fa fa-check-square-o fa-2" aria-hidden="true"></i> What You Need

You need `Python 3.x` and `Jupyter notebooks` to complete this tutorial. Also you should have
an `earth-analytics` directory setup on your computer with a `/data`
directory with it.

{% include/data_subsets/course_earth_analytics/_data-colorado-flood.md %}

## Creating objects

You can get output from `Python` by typing a mathematical equation into the console -
For example, if you type in `3 + 5`, `Python` will calculate the output value.

{:.input}
```python
# Add 3 + 5
3 + 5
```

{:.output}
{:.execute_result}



    8





{:.input}
```python
# Divide 12 by 7
12 / 7
```

{:.output}
{:.execute_result}



    1.7142857142857142





However, is it more useful to assign _values_ to _objects_. To create an object, you need to give it a name followed by the assignment operator `=`, and the value you want to give it:

{:.input}
```python
# Assign weight_kg to the value of 55
weight_kg = 55

# View object value
weight_kg
```

{:.output}
{:.execute_result}



    55





## Expressive readable object names

You can name our objects in python anything that you  want. For example: `x`, `current_temperature`, or
`subject_id`. However, it is best to use clear, descriptive words when naming
objects to ensure your code is easy to follow. Using a naming convention that explains to someone reading the code what the object is or in the case of a function, what it does, is often referenced as as element of Expressive Programming.  

You wil learn best practicing for coding a bit later - in the [clean coding
lesson](/courses/earth-analytics-python/use-time-series-data-in-python/write-clean-code-with-python/). For now, here are some tips to improve your code:

1. **Keep object names short:** this makes them easier to read when scanning through code.
2. **Use meaningful / expressive names that describe the contents of the object that you are creating:** For example: `precip` is a more useful name that tells us something about the object compared to `x`
3. **Don't start names with numbers!** Objects that start with a number are NOT VALID in `Python`.
4. **Avoid names that are existing functions in `Python`:** e.g.,
`if`, `else`, `for`, see
[here](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/keyword-list)

A few other notes about object names in `Python`:

* `Python` is case sensitive (e.g., `weight_kg` is different from `Weight_kg`).
* Avoid other function names (e.g., `c`, `T`, `mean`, `data`, `df`, `weights`).
* Use nouns for variable names, and verbs for function names.
* Avoid using dots in object names - e.g. `my.dataset` - dots have a special meaning in `Python` (for methods) and other programming languages. Instead use underscores `my_dataset`.

## View object value
When assigning a value to an object, `Python` does not print anything. You can force
it to print the value by using parentheses or by typing the name:

{:.input}
```python
# Here weight_kg is assigned to the value 55 however nothing is printed
weight_kg=55  
# A variable name at the end of a cell will be printed by Jupyter notebook
weight_kg 
```

{:.output}
{:.execute_result}



    55





# Python is case sensitive
```
Weight_kg
```

```python
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
NameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-5-243504cb2fcf> in <module>()
      1 # Python is case sensitive
----> 2 Weight_kg

NameError: name 'Weight_kg' is not defined
```

Now that `Python` has stored `weight_kg` in memory, you can do arithmetic with it. For
instance, you may want to convert this weight in pounds (weight in pounds is 2.2
times the weight in kg):

{:.input}
```python
2.2 * weight_kg
```

{:.output}
{:.execute_result}



    121.00000000000001





You can also change a variable's value by assigning it a new value:

{:.input}
```python
weight_kg=57.6
2.2 * weight_kg
```

{:.output}
{:.execute_result}



    126.72000000000001





Assigning a value to one variable does not change the values of
other variables. For example, let's store the animal's weight in pounds in a new
variable, `weight_lb`:

{:.input}
```python
weight_lb = 2.2 * weight_kg
```



and then change `weight_kg` to 100.




{:.input}
```python
weight_kg=100
```

What do you think is the current content of the object `weight_lb`? 126.5 or 200?

## <i class="fa fa-pencil-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> Optional challenge activity

What are the values of each object defined in EACH LINE OF code below?

```python
mass = 47.5            # mass?
age  = 122             # age?
mass = mass * 2.0      # mass?
age  = age - 20        # age?
mass_index = mass / age  # mass_index?
```

Check your answers by running the code in python!
