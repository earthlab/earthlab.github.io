## <i class="fa fa-ship" aria-hidden="true"></i> Section Seven - Write Efficient and Clean Code in Python

In section seven of this textbook, you will learn about best practices and resources for writing clean, expressive code, including the PEP 8 Style Guide for **Python**, which provides useful standards for naming conventions and organization of code to support code readibility. You will also learn how to implement DRY (i.e. Do Not Repeat Yourself) code in **Python** using conditional statements to control the flow of your code as well as loops and custom functions to automate tasks.
