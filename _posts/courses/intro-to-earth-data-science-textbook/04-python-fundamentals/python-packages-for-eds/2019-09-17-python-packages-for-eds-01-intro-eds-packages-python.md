## What is a Python Package

In **Python**, a package is a bundle of pre-built functionality that adds to the functionality available in base **Python**. Base **Python** can do many things such as perform math and other operations. However, **Python** packages can significantly extend this functionality. 

You can think of a **Python** package as a toolbox filled with tools. The tools in the toolbox can be used to do things that you would have to otherwise hand code in base **Python**. These tasks are things that many people might want to do in **Python**, thus warranting the creation of a package. After all, it doesn't make sense for everyone to hand code everything!

For example, the **matplotlib** package allows you to create plots of data. Since most of us create plots routinely, having a **Python** package to create plots makes programming more efficient for everyone who needs to create plots.


## Open Source Python Packages for Earth Data Science

There are many different packages available for **Python**. Some of these are optimized for scientific tasks such as:

* Statistics
* Machine learning
* Using geospatial data
* Plotting & visualizing data
* Accessing data programmatically

and more! The list below contains the core packages that you will use in the upcoming chapters of this textbook to work with scientific data.

* **os**: handle files and directories.
* **glob**: create lists of files and directories for batch processing.
* **matplotlib**: plot data.
* **numpy**: work with data in array formats (often related to imagery and raster format data).
* **pandas**: work with tabular data in a data.frame format.
* **rasterio**: work with raster (image and arrays) data.
* **geopandas**: work with vector format (shapefiles, geojson - points, lines and polygons) using a geodataframe format.
* **earthpy**: plot and manipulate spatial data (raster and vector).


## Where Do Packages Live On Your Computer?

Packages are organized directories of code that can be installed and then imported to your code file (e.g. .py script, **Jupyter Notebook** file). 

When you install a package, you may be wondering, where does it go? If you have not changed any of your default installation settings, the packages that you will use for this textbook are located in your miniconda directory under `envs` (e.g. `/home/username/miniconda/envs/`). 

When you install a package into the conda environment of your choice (for example, `earth-analytics-python` which is the environment that you installed for this textbook and the associated earth analytics courses), it ends up in the `/home/username/miniconda/envs/earth-analytics-python` folder.

    <figcaption>When you install Python packages in an conda environment, they will be located within the /home/username/miniconda/envs/environment-name directory.
    </figcaption>
</figure>

Once packages are installed in your **Python** environment (e.g. `earth-analytics-python` conda environment), you can call them in  **Python** at the command line, in a script (.py file), or in a **Jupyter Notebook** file. 

You have to explicitly call and load (i.e. import) each package that you want to use in your script (.py file) or **Jupyter Notebook** file, in order for the functions (or tools) in that package to be available for use in your code.

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip:**  You can import `Python` packages using `import package-name`. Once a package has been imported, you can call functions from that package

### Python Packages Can Contain Modules

Packages can contain many modules (i.e. units of code) that each provide different functions and can build on each other. For example, the **matplotlib** package provides functionality to plot data using modules, one of which is the commonly used module called **pyplot**.

Every **Python** package should have a unique name. This allows you to import the package using the name with the `import` command. 

For example, the command below imports the **matplotlib** package.

```python
import matplotlib
```

### What is a Module in a Python Package?

Packages often have modules. A module is a set of related functionality that lives within the package. 

For example, **pyplot** is a module within the matplotlib package that makes it easier to quickly setup plots. 

You can import a specific module like **pyplot** by first calling the package name and then the module name - using `.` to separate the names like this:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot

```

You can also import the module using an alias or short name, such as `plt` for `matplotlib.pyplot`.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

```

From the earthpy package, you can import the earthpy module called plot using the alias `ep`:

```python
import earthpy.plot as ep
```

## What is a Python Package Alias?

An alias, as it refers to a **Python** package, is a short version of the package name. The syntax to assign an alias to an imported packages is as follows:

```
import package_name_here as alias_here
```

Alias allows you to call functions from the imported package and/or module using the short name, rather than having to type out the full name of the packages and/or module each time that you want to call a function from it. 

For example, you could call functions from the **pyplot** module to plot using the following code:

```python
matplotlib.pyplot.title("Title Here")

```

However, the code above is long or more verbose than it needs to be. It is easier to use aliases for packages and modules to reduce the amount of text that you have to write to call a function within a module. 

For example, you can create an alias for `matplotlib.pyplot` as `plt` and then use that alias to call the same function as before:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.title("Title Here")

```
Notice that in the above example, you imported the **pyplot** module from the **matplotlib** package using the alias `plt`. 

Now, every time you want to call a function from **pyplot**, you can simply use `plt` (e.g.`plt.title("Title Here")`) rather than `matplotlib.pyplot`(e.g. `matplotlib.pyplot.title("Title Here")`).

## Commonly Used Aliases for Python Packages

There are many packages and modules that have standard alias names. A few commonly used aliases within the **Python** community (and thus used in this textbook) are listed below:

| package.module | alias  |
|---|---|
| matplotlib  | mpl  |
| matplotlib.pyplot  | plt  |
| numpy  | np  |
| pandas  | pd|
| rasterio  | rio|
| geopandas  | gpd|
| earthpy  | et|

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip:** The **os** package has a short name and is not given an alias

## Best Practices for Importing Python Packages In Scientific Code

There are a set of best practices that you should follow when importing **Python** packages in your code. These best practices are outlines in the <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#imports" target="_blank">PEP 8 guidelines</a> and apply to both **Python** scripts and to working in **Jupyter Notebook** files.

### 1. Import Python Libraries at the Top of Your Script or Notebook

It is good practice to import all of the packages that you will need at the top of your **Python** script (.py file) or in the first code cell of a **Jupyter Notebook** file. 

This allows anyone looking at your code to immediately know what packages they need to have installed in order to successfully run the code. This rule also follows the PEP 8 conventions for **Python** code.

<figure>
 <a href="{{ site.url }}/images/courses/earth-analytics/python-interface/import_packages-first-cell.png">
 <img src="{{ site.url }}/images/courses/earth-analytics/python-interface/import_packages-first-cell.png" alt= "Jupyter Notebook with the first code cell importing the numpy package (and many others) to be used with abbreviations or aliases (e.g. np)."></a>
 <figcaption> Jupyter Notebook with the first code cell importing the numpy package (and many others) to be used with abbreviations or aliases (e.g. np for numpy).
 </figcaption>
</figure>

Once you have imported all of the packages that you need to run your code, you have access to all of the functions contained within each package. 

So if these imports are at the top of the script or **Jupyter Notebook** file, then you will be able to use those packages in any code lines that follow. 

In essence, this means that if you import a package *after* running some code that requires that package, your code will not run successfully.


### 2. List Package Imports Following PEP 8 Standards: Most Common First, Followed By Third Party

<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#imports" target="_blank">PEP 8</a> also specifies the order in which you should list your imports as follows (starting with the most commonly used):

> Imports should be grouped in the following order:
>    Standard library imports.
>    Related third party imports.
>    Local application/library specific imports.
> You should put a blank line between each group of imports.

You may be wondering, what is a standard library import? The standard library imports are commonly used tools that are general in purpose and are part of the standard library of **Python**. These including things like:

* **os**: handle files and directories.
* **glob**: create lists of files and directories for batch processing.

In the PEP 8 order, other commonly used packages that are general in purpose will follow such as: 

* **numpy**: work with data in array formats.
* **matplotlib**: plot data.

Third party imports might include geospatial tools and others that are less commonly used. These might include:

* **rasterio**: work with raster (image and arrays) data.
* **geopandas**: work with vector format (shapefiles, geojson - points, lines and polygons) using a geodataframe format.
* **hydrofunctions**: work with hydrological data. 
* **tweepy**: work with Twitter data.

A PEP 8 order of imports for commonly used **Python** packages for science would look something like this:

```
import os
import glob
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import rasterio as rio
import geopandas as gpd
import earthpy as et 
```
