## About the Introduction to Earth Data Science Textbook

Introduction to Earth Data Science is an online textbook for anyone new to open reproducible science and the `Python` programming language. There are no prerequisites for this material, and no prior programming knowledge is assumed. 

This textbook is designed for the Earth Analytics Bootcamp for the <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/earthlab/earth-data-analytics-foundations-professional-certificate" target = "_blank">Earth Data Analytics Professional Certificate </a> taught by instructors at CU Boulder. 

### Overview 

In this textbook, you will learn how to analyze and visualize earth and environmental science data using the `Python` programming language. You will also get familiar with a suite of open source tools that are often used in open reproducible science workflows including `bash`, `git` and `Github.com`, and `Jupyter Notebook`.

This textbook is highly technical, and each chapter covers some aspect of scientific programming and open reproducible science workflows. Additional sections and chapters will continue to be added.
