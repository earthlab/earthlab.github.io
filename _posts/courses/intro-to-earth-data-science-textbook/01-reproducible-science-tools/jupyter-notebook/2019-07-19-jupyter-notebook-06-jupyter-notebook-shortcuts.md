## List of Useful Jupyter Notebook Shortcuts

### Menu Tools vs. Keyboard Shortcuts

As you have seen in this chapter, you can manipulate your `Jupyter Notebook` using the drop-down tools from the menu, with keyboard shortcuts, or using both. 

The table below lists common tasks in `Jupyter Notebook` and how to do them using keyboard shortcuts or the menu tool. 


Function  | Keyboard Shortcut | Menu Tools
--- | --- | ---
Save notebook  | Esc + s | File → Save and Checkpoint
Create new cell| Esc + a (above), Esc + b (below) | Insert→ cell above Insert → cell below 
Run Cell  | Ctrl + enter| Cell → Run Cell 
Copy Cell | c  | Copy Key
Paste Cell | v | Paste Key
Interrupt Kernel| Esc + i i | Kernel → Interrupt 
Restart Kernel | Esc + 0 0 | Kernel → Restart
Find and replace on your code but not the outputs | Esc + f | N/A
merge multiple cells| Shift + M| N/A
When placed before a function Information about a function from its documentation| ? | N/A

For a full list of keyboard shortcuts, click the help button, then the keyboard shortcuts button.

## <i class="fa fa-pencil-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> Practice Your Jupyter Notebook Skills

Test your `Jupyter Notebook` skills to:

1. Launch `Jupyter Notebook` from your `earth-analytics` directory.

2. Create a new `Jupyter Notebook` file called `jupyter-notebook-interface.ipynb`.

3. Add a Code cell and copy/paste the following `Python` code to determine which day had the most precipitation (i.e. the day of the greatest flooding) during the Fall 2013 flood in Boulder, CO, U.S.A. 

```python
# Import necessary packages
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd

# Create data
boulder_precip = pd.DataFrame(columns=["date", "precip"], 
                              data=[
                                  ["2013-09-09", 0.1], ["2013-09-10", 1.0], 
                                  ["2013-09-11", 2.3], ["2013-09-12", 9.8], ["2013-09-13", 1.9],
                                  ["2013-09-14", 0.01], ["2013-09-15", 1.4], ["2013-09-16", 0.4]])      
# Create plot
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.bar(boulder_precip['date'].values, boulder_precip['precip'].values)
ax.set(title="Daily Precipitation (inches)\nBoulder, Colorado 2013", 
       xlabel="Date", ylabel="Precipitation (Inches)")
plt.setp(ax.get_xticklabels(), rotation=45);
```
4. Run the `Python` cell. 

**You have now experienced the benefits of using `Jupyter Notebook` for open reproducible science!**  

Without writing your own code, you were able to easily replicate this analysis because this code block can be shared with and run by anyone using `Python` in `Jupyter Notebook`. 

5. Add a Code cell and run each of the following `Python` calculations:
    * `16 - 4`
    * `24 / 4`
    * `2 * 4`
    * `2 ** 4`
        * What do you notice about the output of `24 / 4` compared to the others? 
        * What operation does `**` execute?

6. Create a new directory called `chap-3` in your `earth-analytics` directory. 

7. Create a new directory called `test` in your `earth-analytics` directory and move it into in the newly created directory called `chap-3`.

8. Delete the `test` directory - do you recall how to find the `test` directory in its new location? 

9. Rename the `Jupyter Notebook` file that you created in step 2 (e.g. `jupyter-notebook-interface.ipynb`) using your first initial and last name (e.g. `jpalomino-jupyter-notebook-interface.ipynb`). 

10. Create a new folder called `chap-3` in your `earth-analytics` directory. 

11. Move your renamed `Jupyter Notebook` file (e.g. `jpalomino-jupyter-notebook-interface.ipynb`) into the new `chap-3` directory.
