After completing this page, you will be able to:

* Undo changes before they've been staged (i.e. you have not yet run `git add` to add or stage them).
* Undo changes after they've been staged with `git add` (but before you run `git commit`) .
* Undo changes after they've been committed to the local repository (but before you have run `git push` to send your files to **Github.com**).

</div>


## Undoing Changes (Before git add)

If you have changed a file but have not yet run `git add`, you can undo changes very simply by running `git checkout`. 

You can specify only one file to undo, for example: 

`git checkout filename.ipynb`

Or you can undo all changes (including all changes that have not been committed!) with:  

`git checkout .`

Follow the steps below to practice undoing changes that occur before `git add`. 

First, modify the README.md file in a repository. You can do this by opening the file in a text editor (e.g. Atom) and making/saving changes there. 

Or, you can use `bash` to add some text to the file using the `echo` command, as shown below. Be sure that you have `cd` to the directory for the repository. 

See the example below (you do not need to type the comment after #):

```bash
# This is a comment in bash; code below will append text 
# to the README.md file in your current working directory
echo 'Some random text for testing' >> README.md
```

After you have made an edit to the file, run `git status` in the **terminal** to see that **git** has identified the change.

When you run `git status`, you will see the following output:

```
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

	modified:   README.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

The output from `git status` also tells you that you can use `git checkout -- <file>` to discard changes to that file in your repo. 

So, if you don't like the changes made to the README.md file, you can revert back to the last committed version using:


```bash
git checkout README.md
```

Run `git status` to check that the changes have been undone.

```bash
git status
```

Which returns:

```
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
nothing to commit, working directory clean
```
The contents of your README.md file has been reverted to the last saved or committed version. 

Thus, you have discarded the most recent changes. You can open the file in a text editor to confirm!

## Unstage Changes (After git add, Before git commit)

Remember that once you add a set of changes to version control using `git add`, the changed file has been staged. 

If a changed file has been staged via `git add`, then you need to use `git reset` to pull the most recently committed version of the file and undo the changes that you've made.

Follow the steps below to practice undoing changes that occur after `git add` but before `git commit`.

First, make a new change to README.md, and run `git add` to stage the changed file (i.e. add to version control). Check the `git status` to see the status of your changes. 

See the example below to make a change to file using `bash` (you do not need to type the comment after #):

```bash
# Comment in bash; modify the README file
echo 'Some more changes' >> README.md
```

Then, run `git add` to stage the file (i.e. add to version control) and run `git status` again.

```bash
git add README.md

git status
```

```
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

	modified:   README.md

```
Fortunately, the output of `git status` again gives us a hint for how to undo staged changes.

You can use `git reset HEAD filename` to unstage your changes. `HEAD` refers to the most recently committed version of the file:


```bash
git reset HEAD README.md
```

Which returns:

```bash
Unstaged changes after reset:
M	README.md
```

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data tip:** HEAD refers to the most recent version of your file. You can also revert to an older version using HEAD~1, HEAD~2 etc. Read more about this on the <a href="http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/05-history/" target="_blank">Software Carpentry git lessons website</a>.
{: .notice--success }

When you use `git reset`, your changes still exist in the file, but the file has been unstaged (i.e. the changes no longer being tracked by version control). 

So now, `git status` will display a message that there are changes that can be added or staged to version control. Thus, it is like you never ran `git add` at all.  


```bash
git status
```

```
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

	modified:   README.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

```

Now that you have changes that are not staged (i.e. not tracked in version control), you can use `git checkout` again to undo those changes. 

```bash
git checkout README.md

git status
```

Which returns that there are no changes in your repository:

```
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
nothing to commit, working directory clean
```

`Git reset` is essentially the opposite of the command `git add`. It will undo the `git add` to remove the changed file from version control, and then you can `git checkout` to undo the changes from the file. 

## Undo Commit (After git commit, Before git push)

If you have committed changes to a file (i.e. you have run both `git add` and `git commit`), and want to undo those changes, then you can use `git reset HEAD~` to undo your commit. 

Similar to the previous example, when you use `git reset HEAD~`, the modifications will be unstaged, and then you can use `git checkout` to undo the changes to the file.

To practice undoing commits, make another change to the README.md.

Then, run `git add` to stage the file (i.e. add to version control) and then run `git commit` to commit the file. Check the `git status` to see the status of your changes. 

```bash
# Comment in bash; modify the README file
echo 'Even more changes.' >> README.md

git commit -m 'Update description in README.md'

git status
```

Which returns:
```
On branch master
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 1 commit.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)
nothing to commit, working directory clean
```

If you do not actually want to `git push` this change to your repository on **GitHub.com**,  you can undo this commit with `git reset HEAD~`:


```bash
git reset HEAD~
```

Which returns:

```bash
Unstaged changes after reset:
M	README.md
```

When you run `git status` again, you will see that the changes have been unstaged from version control. 


```
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

	modified:   README.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

Notice that now your file has been unstaged, and thus, is no longer being tracked! 

At this point, you can run `git checkout README.md` to undo the changes to the file if you want. 

```bash
git checkout README.md

git status
```

```
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
nothing to commit, working directory clean
```

You have now learned how to undo changes using **git** at various stages of the version control process before changed files get pushed to **Github.com**.
