## <i class="fa fa-ship" aria-hidden="true"></i> Chapter Eight - **GitHub** for Collaboration

**GitHub.com** is a website that supports version control using git. In this chapter,
you will learn how to use **GitHub** for both version control and as a collaboration
tool. Specifically, you will learn about a well-known and used collaboration model
that is used in the open software community.

After completing this chapter, you will be able to:

* Explain the difference between **git** and **GitHub**. 
* Describe the open source software collaboration model as it is implemented on **GitHub**. 
* Explain what a pull request (PR) is and how PRs are used on **GitHub**. 
* Create a pull request in **GitHub**.
* Explain what a **GitHub** issue is and explain how issues are used on **GitHub**. 
* Create an issue in **GitHub**.  


## <i class="fa fa-check-square-o fa-2" aria-hidden="true"></i> What You Need

Be sure that you have completed the instructions on <a href="{{ site.url }}/workshops/setup-earth-analytics-python/setup-git-bash-conda/">Setting up Git, Bash, and Conda on your computer</a> to install the tools for your operating system (Windows, Mac, Linux).

Be sure that you have completed the chapter on <a href="{{ site.url }}/courses/intro-to-earth-data-science/git-github/version-control/">version control with git and GitHub</a>.

You will also need a web browser and your **GitHub.com** login (username and password).

## Why Use GitHub For Science Collaboration?

In the previous chapter, you learned about **git** and **GitHub**. Recall that **git** is a
tool that is used to manage version control for various files. **GitHub.com** is a
website that runs **git** behind the scenes. 

The **GitHub.com** website also has additional
functionality that extends the functionality of **git**. This functionality allows
you to manage projects and coordinate with others on updates to code, text files,
and other files in your repo. **GitHub** also facilitates sharing your code with the
world (OR with specific people if you need to work with a smaller group of people privately).

In the next few lessons, you will learn more about the various **GitHub** tools that you
can use to collaborate on projects.

## GitHub For Project Management and Collaboration

There are several tools that **GitHub** offers that you can use to support
collaborating on projects.

### 1. GitHub Pull Requests

A pull request is a way that you or a colleague can suggest code changes to a repository.

A pull request allows:
   * Your collaborators to see exactly what items were changed line by line in the code.
   * A group of people working on the code to view, review and comment on the code line by line.
   * You to document changes to your project which can also be clearly linked to issues that describe the need for those changes (see below).

The pull request is a great way to ensure that everyone is on the same page with
your edits before the changes are merged or combined into the designated repository.

Pull Requests are specific to the **GitHub** website.

### 2. GitHub Issues

Issues in **GitHub** are ways to document and discuss changes needed in a repository.
Issues are also ideal for managing changes in a project.

Issues are normally text (and code) that describe something that needs to be
addressed in the repository. An issue could be related to something that needs to be fixed in your
code or text. 

Issues can be assigned to one or more people to work on which
makes them useful for project management. You can keep track of who is working
on what items in the repository. 

Once an issue is defined (with requested
changes to the code in your repo), you can then assign it to someone. At that point, you have documentation of who is working on what task. Finally,
when the person assigned an issue submits a pull request to address that issue, they can link the pull request back to the
original issues.

If you are familiar with IT (Information Technology) groups or computer help
desks, this is similar to submitting a ticket,
except for this ticket can be created collaboratively. 

Linking issues to pull requests is good practice and will be discussed in more detail later in this
chapter.

### 3. GitHub Project Milestones

There are other project management tools within **GitHub** that you can use to
manage your project as it becomes more complex, including milestones and even Trello like project boards. 

If you are working on a large project, you can create milestones which can be
 used to group sets of related issues together. Milestones can have deadlines
 associated with them.

### 4. **GitHub** Project Management Tools

You can also use **GitHub** to manage an entire project or set of projects. You can
setup boards similar to a tool like Trello to manage pull requests and milestones,
who is working on what and associated deadlines. 

These more advanced **GitHub** project management tools are not
discussed in this chapter, but you are encouraged to check them out if you are interested in using **GitHub** to manage your open science projects.

## Putting It All Together: the Open Source Collaboration and Project Management Model 

### GitHub Issues and Pull Requests

Over the course of this chapter, you will learn how to put together all of the
pieces of the pull request workflow. To break it down, it looks something like this:

1. Individuals within your team identify issues that need to be addressed.
2. Someone (likely the owners of the repository) assigns team members to work on specific issues.
3. Team members work on their individual tasks.
4. When they are ready to suggest changes, team members submit a pull request (PR) to the main repository. That pull request is reviewed by team leaders (or whomever is assigned to review).
5. The reviewers may suggest changes to the code. If so, the PR submitters go back and work on the code some more. This process may continue until everyone is happy with the PR.
6. When the PR is approved by the reviewers, it will be merged into the code base of the repository.

All of the above steps may be repeated over and over through time, as issues are identified and contributors submit changes. 

This is the open source collaborative software workflow and a workflow that many use to manage **GitHub** projects in general.

In this chapter, you will first learn about and practice submitting pull requests to update repositories. In the second half of the chapter, you will be exposed to the full open source collaboration workflow, including the use of issues.
