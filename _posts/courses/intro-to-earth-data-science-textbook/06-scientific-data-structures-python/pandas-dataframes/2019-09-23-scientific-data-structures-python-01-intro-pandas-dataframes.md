## <i class="fa fa-ship" aria-hidden="true"></i> Chapter Fifteen - Pandas Dataframes

In this chapter, you will learn about another commonly used data structure in Python for scientific data: **pandas** dataframes. You will write **Python** code to import text data (.csv) as **pandas** dataframes and to run calculations and summarize data in **pandas** dataframes.

After completing this chapter, you will be able to:

* Describe the key characteristics of **pandas** dataframes.
* Import tabular data from .csv files into **pandas** dataframes.
* Run calculations and summarize data in **pandas** dataframes.
* Use indexing to select data from **pandas** dataframes.

## What are Pandas Dataframes

In the chapters introducing **Python** lists and **numpy** arrays, you learn that both of these data structures can store collections of values, instead of just single values. 

You also learned that while **Python** lists are flexible and can store data items of various types (e.g. integers, floats, text strings), **numpy** arrays require all data elements to be of the same type. Because of this requirement, **numpy** arrays can provide more functionality for running calculations such as element-by-element arithmetic operations (e.g. multiplication of each element in the `numpy array` by the same value) that **Python** lists do not support.  

In this chapter, you will learn about **Pandas** dataframes, which provide the ability to work with tabular data. 

**Pandas** dataframes are data structures that are composed of rows and columns that can have header names, and the columns in **pandas** dataframes can be different types (e.g. the first column containing integers and the second column containing text strings). 

Each value in **pandas** dataframe is referred to as a cell that has a specific row index and column index within the tabular structure. 

The dataset below of average monthly precipitation (inches) for Boulder, CO provided by the <a href="https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/boulder/Boulder.mm.precip.html" target="_blank"> U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)</a> is an example of the type of tabular dataset that can be imported into a **pandas** dataframe. 

month  | precip_in |
--- | --- |
Jan | 0.70 |
Feb | 0.75 |
Mar | 1.85 |
Apr | 2.93 |
May | 3.05 |
June | 2.02 |
July | 1.93 |
Aug | 1.62 |
Sept | 1.84 |
Oct | 1.31 |
Nov | 1.39 |
Dec | 0.84 |


## Distinguishing Characteristics of Pandas Dataframes

These characteristics (i.e. tabular format with rows and columns that can have headers) make **pandas** dataframes very versatile for not only storing different types, but for maintaining the relationships between cells across the same row and/or column. 

Recall that in the chapter on **numpy** arrays, you could not easily connect the values across two numpy arrays, such as those for `precip` and `months`. 

Within **pandas** dataframes (such as the example above), the relationship between the value `January` in the `months` column and the value `0.70` in the `precip` column is maintained. 

These two values (`January` and `0.70`) are considered the same record, representing the same observation in the **pandas** dataframe.

In addition, **pandas** dataframes have other unique characteristics that differentiate them from **numpy** arrays:

1. Each column in a **pandas** dataframe can have a labeled name (i.e. header name such as `months`) and can contain a different type of data from its neighboring columns. 
2. Cells within the **pandas** dataframe are always identified by its combined row and column index (e.g. `[row index, column index]`). All cells have both a row index and a column index, even if there is only one row and/or one column in the **pandas** dataframe.
3. In addition to querying values through location indexing (i.e. row index, column index), you can also query for data within **pandas** dataframes based on specific values or attributes (i.e. filtering values). 
4. Because of the tabular indexing, you can query and run calculations on **pandas** dataframes across an entire row, an entire column, or a specific cell or series of cells based on either location and attribute values. 
5. Due to its inherent tabular structure, **pandas** dataframes also allow for cells to have `null` or blank values.


## Tabular Structure of Pandas Dataframes

The structure of a **pandas** dataframe includes the column names and the rows that represent individual observations (i.e. records).  

The function `DataFrame` from **pandas** (e.g. `pd.DataFrame`) can be used to manually define a **pandas** dataframe by providing a list of column names (`columns`) and a list of data values (`data`) for each column (one value for each column). 

**Pandas** dataframes can have many columns that each contain a different type of data (e.g. strings, floats). 

In the example below, the **pandas** dataframe stores the average monthly precipitation values in inches for Boulder, CO.  The **pandas** dataframe contains one column with abbreviated month names as text strings and one column for the precipitation (inches) as numeric values.

{:.input}
```python
# Import pandas with alias pd
import pandas as pd
```

{:.input}
```python
# Average monthly precip for Boulder, CO
avg_monthly_precip = pd.DataFrame(columns=["month", "precip_in"],
                                  data=[
                                      ["Jan", 0.70],  ["Feb", 0.75],
                                      ["Mar", 1.85],  ["Apr", 2.93],
                                      ["May", 3.05],  ["June", 2.02],
                                      ["July", 1.93], ["Aug", 1.62],
                                      ["Sept", 1.84], ["Oct", 1.31],
                                      ["Nov", 1.39],  ["Dec", 0.84]])

You can see from the **pandas** dataframe that each row has an index value, and that the indexing still begins with `[0]`, as it does for `Python` lists and `numpy arrays`. 

In the pages that follow, you will learn how to import data from .csv files into **pandas** dataframes, run calculations and summary statistics on **pandas** dataframes, and select data from **pandas** dataframes.
