## <i class="fa fa-ship" aria-hidden="true"></i> Section Three - Intro to Spatial Vector Data in Python

In section three of this textbook, you will learn how to work with and plot spatial vector data using the **geopandas** package for **Python**. 


## <i class="fa fa-graduation-cap" aria-hidden="true"></i> Learning Objectives

After completing this section of the textbook, you will be able to:

* Describe the characteristics of 3 key vector data structures: points, lines and polygons.
* Open a shapefile in **Python** using **geopandas**.
* View the CRS and other spatial metadata of a vector spatial layer in **Python**
* Be able to describe what a Coordinate Reference System (CRS) is.
* List 2-3 fundamental differences between a geographic and a projected CRS.
* Identify the CRS of a spatial dataset and reproject it to another CRS in **Python**.
* Clip a spatial vector point and line layer to the spatial extent of a polygon layer in **Python** using **geopandas**.
* Dissolve polygons based upon an attribute in **Python** using **geopandas**.
* Join spatial attributes from one shapefile to another in **Python** using **geopandas**.
