## <i class="fa fa-ship" aria-hidden="true"></i> Chapter Five - Raster Data Processing in Python 

In this chapter, you will learn how to process raster data. You will learn how to 
crop, reproject and reclassify raster data.

## <i class="fa fa-graduation-cap" aria-hidden="true"></i> Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, you will be able to:

* Use raster math in **Python** to derive new rasters, such as a Canopy Height Model (CHM).
* Reclassify a raster dataset in **Python** using a set of defined values. 
* Crop a raster dataset in **Python** using a vector extent object derived from a shapefile.
* Reproject a raster using **rasterio**.

## <i class="fa fa-check-square-o fa-2" aria-hidden="true"></i> What You Need

You will need a computer with internet access to complete this lesson.
