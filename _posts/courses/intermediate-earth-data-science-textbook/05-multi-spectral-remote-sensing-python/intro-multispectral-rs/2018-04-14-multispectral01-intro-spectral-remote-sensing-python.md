## About Spectral Remote Sensing

In the previous weeks of this course, you learned about lidar remote sensing. If
you recall, a lidar instrument is an active remote sensing instrument. This means
that the instrument emits energy actively rather than collecting information about
light energy from another source (the sun). This week you will work with multispectral
imagery or multispectral remote sensing data. Multispectral remote sensing is a
passive remote sensing type. This means that the sensor is measuring light energy
from an existing source - in this case the sun.

## Electromagnetic Spectrum

To better understand multispectral remote sensing you need to know
some basic principles of the electromagnetic spectrum.

The electromagnetic spectrum is composed of a range of different wavelengths or
"colors" of light energy. A spectral remote sensing instrument collects
light energy within specific regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Each
region in the spectrum is referred to as a band.

# Key Attributes of Spectral Remote Sensing Data

## Space vs Airborne Data

Remote sensing data can be collected from the ground, the air (using airplanes or
helicopters) or from space. You can
imagine that data that are collected from space are often of a lower spatial
resolution than data collected from an airplane. The tradeoff however
is that data collected from a satellite often offers better (up to global) coverage.

For example the Landsat 8 satellite has a 16 day repeat cycle for the entire globe.
This means that you can find a new image for an area, every 16 days. It takes a
lot of time and financial resources to collect airborne data. Thus data are often
only available for smaller geographic areas. Also, you may not find that the data are
available for the time periods that you need. For example, in the case of NAIP, you may
only have a new dataset every 2-4 years.

   are often of lower resolution, however, because a satellite rotates continuously
   around the earth, the spatial coverage may be better than airborne data. Source: Cartospace

## Bands and Wavelengths

When talking about spectral data, you need to understand both the electromagnetic
spectrum and image bands. Spectral remote sensing data are collected by powerful
camera-like instruments known as imaging spectrometers. Imaging spectrometers
collect reflected light energy in "bands."

A *band* represents a segment of the electromagnetic
spectrum. You can think of it as a bin of one "type" of light. For example, the
wavelength values between 800 nanometers (nm) and 850 nm might be one
band captured by an imaging spectrometer. The imaging spectrometer collects
reflected light energy within a pixel area on the ground. Since an imaging spectrometer
collects many different types of light - for each pixel the amount of light energy
for each type of light or band will be recorded. So, for example, a camera records
the amount of red, green and blue light for each pixel.

Often when you work with a multispectral dataset, the band information is reported as the center
wavelength value. This value represents the center point value of the wavelengths
represented in that  band. Thus in a band spanning 800-850 nm, the center would
be 825 nm.

    <figcaption>Imaging spectrometers collect reflected light information within defined bands or regions of the electromagnetic spectrum.</figcaption>
</figure>

## Spectral Resolution
The spectral resolution of a dataset that has more than one band, refers to the
spectral width of each band in the dataset. In the image above, a band was
defined as spanning 800-810 nm. The spectral width or spectral resolution of the
band is thus 10 nm. To see an example of this, check out the band widths
for the <a href="http://landsat.usgs.gov/band_designations_landsat_satellites.php" target="_blank">Landsat sensors</a>.

While a general spectral resolution of the sensor is often provided, not all
sensors collect information within bands of uniform widths.

## Spatial Resolution

The spatial resolution of a raster represents the area on the ground that each
pixel covers. If you have smaller pixels in a raster the data will appear more
"detailed." If you have large pixels in a raster, the data will appear more
coarse or "fuzzy."

If high resolution data shows you more about what is happening on the Earth's surface
why wouldn't you always just collect high resolution data (smaller
pixels)?

If you recall, you learned about raster spatial resolution when you worked with lidar
elevation data in previous lessons. The same resolution concepts apply to multispectral data.

## What is Multispectral Imagery?

### Introduction to Multi-Band Raster Data

Earlier in this course, you worked with raster data derived from lidar remote sensing
instruments. These rasters consisted of one layer or band and contained 
height values derived from lidar data. In this lesson, you will
learn how to work with rasters containing multispectral imagery data stored within
multiple bands (or layers).

Just like you did with single band rasters, you will use the `rasterio.open()` function to open multi band raster data in **Python**.  

* To import multi-band raster data you will use the `stack()` function.
* If your multi-band data are imagery that you wish to composite into a color image, you can use the `earthpy`
`plot_rgb()` function to plot a 3 band raster image.

    raster.">

    raster. Source: Colin Williams, NEON.</figcaption>
</figure>


One type of multispectral imagery that is familiar to many of us is a color
image. A color image consists of three bands: red, green, and blue. Each
band represents light reflected from the red, green or blue portions of the
electromagnetic spectrum. The pixel brightness for each band, when composited
creates the colors that you see in an image. These colors are the ones your eyes
can see within the visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum.

You can plot each band of a multi-band image individually using a grayscale
color gradient. Remember from the videos that you watched in class that the
LIGHTER colors represent a stronger reflection
in that band. DARKER colors represent a weaker reflection.

### RBG Plot 

You can plot the red, green and blue bands together to create an RGB image. This is
what you would see with our eyes if you were in the airplane looking down at the earth.

### Each band plotted separately

Note there are four bands below. You are looking at the red, green, blue and near
infrared bands of a NAIP image. What do you notice about the relative darkness /
lightness of each image? Is one image brighter than the other?

### Color Infrared (CIR) Image

If the image has a 4th NIR band, you can create a CIR (sometimes called false color)
image. In a color infrared image, the NIR band is plotted on the "red" band. Thus vegetation, which reflects strongly in the NIR part of the spectrum, is colored "red". CIR images are often used to better understand vegetation cover and health in an area.

### Other Types of Multi-band Raster Data

Multi-band raster data might also contain:

1. **Time series:** the same variable, over the same area, over time.
2. **Multi or hyperspectral imagery:** image rasters that have 4 or more (multi-spectral) or more than 10-15 (hyperspectral) bands.

Recall that you have worked with time series data in earlier chapters of this textbook.

## NAIP, Landsat & MODIS

To begin working with multispectral remote sensing data, you will look at 2 sources of data:

1. NAIP: National Agricultural Imagery Program data
2. Landsat: Landuse Satellite 

Later in the textbook, you will also work with MODIS (Moderate Imaging Spectrometer) data.

### About NAIP Multispectral Imagery

NAIP imagery is available in the United States and typically has three bands -
red, green and blue. However, sometimes, there is a 4th near-infrared band available.
NAIP imagery typically is 1m spatial resolution, meaning that each pixel represents
1 meter on the Earth's surface. NAIP data is often collected using a camera mounted on
an airplane and is collected for a given geographic area every few years.

### Landsat 8 Imagery

Compared to NAIP, Landsat data are collected using an instrument mounted on a
satellite which orbits the globe, continuously collecting images. The Landsat
instrument collects data at 30 meter spatial resolution but also has 11 bands
distributed across the electromagnetic spectrum compared to the 3 or 4 that
NAIP imagery has. Landsat also has one panchromatic band that collects information
across the visible portion of the spectrum at 15 m spatial resolution.

Landsat 8 bands 1-9 are listed below:

#### Landsat 8 Bands

| Band | Wavelength range (nm) | Spatial Resolution (m) | Spectral Width (nm)|
|-------------------------------------|------------------|--------------------|----------------|
| Band 1 - Coastal aerosol | 430 - 450 | 30 | 2.0 |
| Band 2 - Blue | 450 - 510 | 30 | 6.0 |
| Band 3 - Green | 530 - 590 | 30 | 6.0 |
| Band 4 - Red | 640 - 670 | 30 | 0.03 |
| Band 5 - Near Infrared (NIR) | 850 - 880 | 30 | 3.0 |
| Band 6 - SWIR 1 | 1570 - 1650 | 30 | 8.0  |
| Band 7 - SWIR 2 | 2110 - 2290 | 30 | 18 |
| Band 8 - Panchromatic | 500 - 680 | 15 | 18 |
| Band 9 - Cirrus | 1360 - 1380 | 30 | 2.0 |

### MODIS Imagery

The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) instrument is another
satellite based instrument that continuously collects
data over the Earth's surface. MODIS collects spectral information at several
spatial resolutions including 250m, 500m and 1000m. You will be working with the
500 m spatial resolution MODIS data in this class. MODIS has 36 bands
however in class you will learn about only the first 7 bands.

#### First 7 MODIS Bands

Below, you can see the first 7 bands of the MODIS instrument

| Band | Wavelength range (nm) | Spatial Resolution (m) | Spectral Width (nm)|
|-------------------------------------|------------------|--------------------|----------------|
| Band 1 - red | 620 - 670 | 250 | 2.0 |
| Band 2 - near infrared | 841 - 876 | 250 | 6.0 |
| Band 3 -  blue/green | 459 - 479 | 500 | 6.0 |
| Band 4 - green | 545 - 565 | 500 | 3.0 |
| Band 5 - near infrared  | 1230 | 1250 | 500 | 8.0  |
| Band 6 - mid-infrared | 1628 | 1652 | 500 | 18 |
| Band 7 - mid-infrared | 2105 - 2155 | 500 | 18 |
