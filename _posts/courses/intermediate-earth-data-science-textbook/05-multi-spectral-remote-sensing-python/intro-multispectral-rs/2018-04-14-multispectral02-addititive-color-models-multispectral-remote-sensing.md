The 2:30 minute video below shows the difference between additive and subtractive
light models and demonstrates subtractive models with paints.

The ~3 minute video below has no sound, but look closely as they zoom in on the pixels of
an old school computer monitor. You will notice that each  pixel is composed of three
types of light red, green and blue.
