## <i class="fa fa-ship" aria-hidden="true"></i> Section Five - Multispectral Remote Sensing Data in Python

In section four of this textbook, you will learn how to work with multispectral remote sensing data in **Python**, including National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP), Landsat, and MODIS. 

## <i class="fa fa-graduation-cap" aria-hidden="true"></i> Learning Objectives

After completing this section of the textbook, you will be able to:

* Describe *at least* 3 differences between NAIP, Landsat, and MODIS imagery, in terms of how the data are collected, how frequently they are collected and the spatial and spectral resolution.
* Plot and analyze these data in **Python**.
