## <i class="fa fa-graduation-cap" aria-hidden="true"></i> Learning Objectives

After completing this tutorial, you will be able to:

* Connect to the twitter RESTful API to access twitter data with `Python`.
* Generate custom queries that download tweet data into `Python` using `Tweepy`.
* Access tweet metadata including users in `Python` using `Tweepy`.

## <i class="fa fa-check-square-o fa-2" aria-hidden="true"></i> What You Need

You will need a computer with internet access to complete this lesson.

</div>

In this lesson, you will explore analyzing social media data accessed from Twitter using Python. You will use the Twitter RESTful API to access data about both Twitter users and what they are tweeting about. 

## Getting Started

To get started, you'll need to do the following things:

1. Set up a Twitter account if you don't have one already.
2. Using your Twitter account, you will need to apply for Developer Access and then create an application that will generate the API credentials that you will use to access Twitter from `Python`. 
3. Import the `tweepy` package.

Once you've done these things, you are ready to begin querying Twitter's API to see what you can learn about tweets!

## Set up Twitter App 

After you have applied for <a href = "https://apps.twitter.com/" target="_blank">Developer Access</a>, you can create an application in Twitter that you can use to access tweets. Make sure you already have a Twitter account. 

To create your application, you can follow a useful tutorial from `rtweet`, which includes a section on Create an application that is not specific to R:

<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rtweet/vignettes/auth.html" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-info-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i>TUTORIAL: How to setup a Twitter application using your Twitter account</a>

NOTE: you will need to provide a phone number that can receive text messages (e.g. mobile or Google phone number) to Twitter to verify your use of the API.

## Access Twitter API in Python 

Once you have your Twitter app set-up, you are ready to access tweets in `Python`. Begin by importing the necessary `Python` libraries. 

{:.input}
```python
import os
import tweepy as tw
import pandas as pd
```

To access the Twitter API, you will need 4 things from the your Twitter App page. These keys are located in your Twitter app settings in the `Keys and Access Tokens` tab.

* consumer key
* consumer seceret key
* access token key 
* access token secret key 

Do not share these with anyone else because these values are specific to your app. 

First you will need define your keys

```Python
consumer_key= 'yourkeyhere'
consumer_secret= 'yourkeyhere'
access_token= 'yourkeyhere'
access_token_secret= 'yourkeyhere'
```


{:.input}
```python
auth = tw.OAuthHandler(consumer_key, consumer_secret)
auth.set_access_token(access_token, access_token_secret)
api = tw.API(auth, wait_on_rate_limit=True)
```

### Send a Tweet

You can send tweets using your API access. Note that your tweet needs to be 280 characters or less.

```python
# Post a tweet from Python
api.update_status("Look, I'm tweeting from #Python in my #earthanalytics class! @EarthLabCU")
# Your tweet has been posted!
```

### Search Twitter for Tweets

Now you are ready to search Twitter for recent tweets! Start by finding recent tweets that use the `#wildfires` hashtag. You will use the `.Cursor` method to get an object containing tweets containing the hashtag `#wildfires`. 

To create this query, you will define the:
1. Search term - in this case `#wildfires`
2. the start date of your search

Remember that the Twitter API only allows you to access the past few weeks of tweets, so you cannot dig into the history too far.

{:.input}
```python
# Define the search term and the date_since date as variables
search_words = "#wildfires"
date_since = "2018-11-16"
```

Below you use `.Cursor()` to search twitter for tweets containing the search term #wildfires. You can restrict the number of tweets returned by specifying a number in the `.items()` method. `.items(5)` will return 5 of the most recent tweets.


```python
# Collect tweets
tweets = tw.Cursor(api.search,
              q=search_words,
              lang="en",
              since=date_since).items(5)
tweets

```

```
<tweepy.cursor.ItemIterator at 0x7fafc296e400>
```

`.Cursor()` returns an object that you can iterate or loop over to access the data collected. Each item in the iterator has various attributes that you can access to get information about each tweet including:

1. the text of the tweet
2. who sent the tweet
3. the date the tweet was sent

and more. The code below loops through the object and prints the text associated with each tweet.



```python
# Collect tweets
tweets = tw.Cursor(api.search,
              q=search_words,
              lang="en",
              since=date_since).items(5)

# Iterate and print tweets
for tweet in tweets:
    print(tweet.text)
    
```

The above approach uses a standard for loop. However, this is an excellent place to use a Python list comprehension. A list comprehension provides an efficient way to collect object elements contained within an iterator as a list.


```python
# Collect tweets
tweets = tw.Cursor(api.search,
                       q=search_words,
                       lang="en",
                       since=date_since).items(5)

# Collect a list of tweets
[tweet.text for tweet in tweets]

```

## To Keep or Remove Retweets

A retweet is when someone shares someone else's tweet. It is similar to sharing in Facebook. Sometimes you may want to remove retweets as they contain duplicate content that might skew your analysis if you are only looking at word frequency. Other times, you may want to keep retweets. 

Below you ignore all retweets by adding `-filter:retweets` to your query. The <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/rules-and-filtering/overview/standard-operators" target="_blank">Twitter API documentation</a> has information on other ways to customize your queries. 

{:.input}
```python
new_search = search_words + " -filter:retweets"
new_search
```

{:.output}
{:.execute_result}



    '#wildfires -filter:retweets'





{:.input}
```python
tweets = tw.Cursor(api.search,
                       q=new_search,
                       lang="en",
                       since=date_since).items(5)

[tweet.text for tweet in tweets]
```

{:.output}
{:.execute_result}

## Who is Tweeting About Wildfires?

You can access a wealth of information associated with each tweet. Below is an example of accessing the users who are sending the tweets related to #wildfires and their locations. Note that user locations are manually entered into Twitter by the user. Thus, you will see a lot of variation in the format of this value. 

* `tweet.user.screen_name` provides the user's twitter handle associated with each tweet. 
* `tweet.user.location` provides the user's provided location. 

You can experiment with other items available within each tweet by typing `tweet.` and using the tab button to see all of the available attributes stored. 


{:.input}
```python
tweets = tw.Cursor(api.search, 
                           q=new_search,
                           lang="en",
                           since=date_since).items(5)

users_locs = [[tweet.user.screen_name, tweet.user.location] for tweet in tweets]
users_locs
```

{:.output}
{:.execute_result}



    [['PacesInPlaces', 'Seattle, WA'],
     ['JJSFireSupply', 'Florida and California'],
     ['Nice_guy_T', 'London UK'],
     ['citizens_fla', '866.411.2742'],
     ['Optimizics', 'Boston, MA']]





## Create a `Pandas Dataframe` From A List of Tweet Data

One you have a list of items that you wish to work with, you can create a pandas dataframe that contains that data. 

{:.input}
```python
tweet_text = pd.DataFrame(data=users_locs, 
                    columns=['user', "location"])
tweet_text
```

{:.output}
{:.execute_result}



<div>
<style scoped>
    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {
        vertical-align: middle;
    }

    .dataframe tbody tr th {
        vertical-align: top;
    }

    .dataframe thead th {
        text-align: right;
    }
</style>
<table border="1" class="dataframe">

      <th>user</th>
      <th>location</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>0</th>
      <td>PacesInPlaces</td>
      <td>Seattle, WA</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>1</th>
      <td>JJSFireSupply</td>
      <td>Florida and California</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>2</th>
      <td>Nice_guy_T</td>
      <td>London UK</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>3</th>
      <td>citizens_fla</td>
      <td>866.411.2742</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>4</th>
      <td>Optimizics</td>
      <td>Boston, MA</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>





## Customizing Twitter Queries

As mentioned above, you can customize your Twitter search queries by following the <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/rules-and-filtering/overview/standard-operators" target="_blank">Twitter API documentation</a>. 

For instance, if you search for `climate+change`, Twitter will return all tweets that contain both of those words (in a row) in each tweet. 

Note that the code below creates a list that can be queried using Python indexing to return the first five tweets. 


```python
new_search = "climate+change -filter:retweets"

tweets = tw.Cursor(api.search,
                   q=new_search,
                   lang="en",
                   since='2018-04-23').items(1000)

all_tweets = [tweet.text for tweet in tweets]
all_tweets[:5]

```
