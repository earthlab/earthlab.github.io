## What Is Open Reproducible Science

Open science in a nutshell is about making scientific methods, data and outcomes available to everyone. It can be broken down into several parts (<a href="http://www.openscience.org/blog/?p=269" target="_blank">Gezelter 2009</a>) including:

* Transparency in experimental methodology, observation, and collection of data.
* Public availability and reusability of scientific data.
* Public accessibility and transparency of scientific communication.
* Using web-based tools to facilitate scientific collaboration.

Reproducible science is when anyone (including others and your future self!) can understand and replicate the steps of an analysis, applied to the same or even new data. 

Open reproducible science results from open science workflows that allow you to easily share work and collaborate with others as well as openly publish your workflows to contribute to greater science knowledge.

## Benefits of Open Reproducible Science

There are many benefits of openness and reproducibility in science including:
* transparency in the scientific process, as anyone including the general public can access the data, methods and results. 
* ease of replication of analyses by others, which further supports peer review and collaborative learning in the scientific community. 
* it supports you! You can easily understand and re-run your own analyses as often as needed and after time has passed.
