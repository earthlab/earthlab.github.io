## Create Directories in Jupyter Notebook Dashboard

To create a new directory using the `Jupyter Notebook` dashboard, you can click on the drop-down menu labeled `New`, and then select `Folder`.

Note that new directories are created as `Untitled.ipynb`.


## Rename Directories in Jupyter Notebook Dashboard

To rename a directory, you can select the checkbox to the left of the directory name (e.g. `Untitled.ipynb`) and then clicking on the option `Rename`, which becomes available in the menu bar after the checkbox is enabled.

## Move Directories in Jupyter Notebook Dashboard

Similarly, you can move a directory by selecting the checkbox to the left of the directory name (e.g. `Untitled.ipynb`) and then clicking on the option `Move`.

A new window will open for you to specify the new path for the directory. Once you have specified a path, you can click on `Move` to move the directory into the path you provided.

## Delete Directories in Jupyter Notebook Dashboard

You can also delete directories in the `Jupyter Notebook` dashboard  by selecting the checkbox to the left of the directory name (e.g. `Untitled.ipynb`) and then clicking on the red trashcan icon that appears. 

Note that this action will delete any directory that is selected in the list, enabling you to delete multiple directories at one time. 

Another important thing to remember is that deleting a directory in the `Jupyter Notebook` dashboard will delete all of the directory's contents including any subdirectories. So take care when deleting directories!
