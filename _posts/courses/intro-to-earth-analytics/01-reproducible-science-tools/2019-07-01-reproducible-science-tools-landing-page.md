## <i class="fa fa-ship" aria-hidden="true"></i> Section One - An Introduction to Open Reproducible Science Tools

In section one of this textbook, you will learn about open reproducible science. You will learn about a suite of open source tools that are often used in open reproducible science workflows including `Bash`/`Shell`, `git` and `Github.com`, `Python`, and the `Jupyter` ecosystem, including `Jupyter Notebook`. 


## <i class="fa fa-graduation-cap" aria-hidden="true"></i> Learning Objectives

After completing this section of the introduction to earth analytics online textbook, you will be able to:

* Define open reproducible science and explain its importance.
* Describe how reproducibility can benefit you and others.
* Identify best practices for reproducible science. 
* Run `Bash` commands in the terminal to work with files and directories on your computer.
* Launch and navigate the `Jupyter Notebook` dashboard.
* Run code and `Markdown` cells within `Jupyter Notebook` to execute `Python` code and render `Markdown` text.
