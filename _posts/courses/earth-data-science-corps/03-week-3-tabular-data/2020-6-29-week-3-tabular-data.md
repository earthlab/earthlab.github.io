## <i class="fa fa-ship" aria-hidden="true"></i> Welcome to Week 3

Welcome to week 3 of the Earth Data Science Corps! This week you will learn to work with tabular data in Python.

</div>

## <i class="fa fa-pencil"></i> Homework 3: Due Next Week - Thurs, June 25 (9am MT / 10am CT)

For this assignment, you will work through self-paced exercises that introduce core concepts in Python programming including:
* Complete the readings below which review common spatial data types and formats that you can use in Python to complete scientific analyses, including spatial vector data and raster data.
* Complete Jupyter Notebooks that review the various data types


### Readings

* Read all lessons in: 
    * <a href="{{ site.url }}/courses/use-data-open-source-python/intro-vector-data-python/spatial-data-vector-shapefiles/">Chapter 2: Spatial Data in Python</a> in the Introduction to Earth Data Science online textbook.  

    * <a href="{{ site.url }}/courses/use-data-open-source-python/intro-vector-data-python/vector-data-processing/">Chapter 3: Processing Spatial Vector Data in Python</a> in the Introduction to Earth Data Science online textbook. 

    * <a href="{{ site.url }}/courses/use-data-open-source-python/intro-raster-data-python/fundamentals-raster-data/">Chapter 4: Introduction to Raster Data in Python</a> in the Introduction to Earth Data Science online textbook. 

    * <a href="{{ site.url }}/courses/use-data-open-source-python/intro-raster-data-python/raster-data-processing/">Chapter 5: Processing Raster Data in Python</a> in the Introduction to Earth Data Science online textbook. 

If you would like to follow the code in the readings, you can use the JupyterHub environment which is accessible via a web browser with an active internet connection. Recall that you need to use your GitHub account to login.  You can also use your local computer if you have successfully <a href="{{ site.url }}/workshops/setup-earth-analytics-python/">set-up your local computing environment</a>.
