## <i class="fa fa-ship" aria-hidden="true"></i> Welcome to Week 7

Welcome to week 7 of the Earth Data Science Corps! This week you will learn to to create workflow diagram to plan your project work.

</div>

## <i class="fa fa-pencil"></i> Homework 6: Due Next Week - Fri, July 24th (9am MT / 10am CT)

At this point, you have chosen your project and developed a Message Box that communicates the important parts of your project. Your next step will be to develop a workflow diagram that outlines the high-level steps that you will need to process your data and complete your project.

For this assignment submission, you will follow the steps below.

### Step One: Answer the following Questions

Above your diagram, answer the following questions:
1. What is your question or challenge that your data analysis needs to address.
2. What are your project outcomes or end products?
3. List the data that you will need to achieve these outcomes.
4. Has any work like this been done before or are there any resources that can guide your workflow (lessons, tutorials, other studies, etc?
5. What methods do you need to learn more about?

### Step Two: Create a Workflow Diagram For Your Project Using the Jupyter Notebook mentioned below

Create a one-page diagram that outlines your project workflow. 

Start by opening the workflow notebook on JupyterHub in the workflow folder. 

You can draft this workflow diagram using whatever tool that you like (e.g. Word, Paint, Google Docs, by hand). A few suggested free tolls include:
* <a href="https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/">Lucidchart</a>
* <a href="https://medium.com/pm101/8-flowcharts-and-diagrams-apps-837373859e87">List of other free tools</a>

Be sure to save your workflow diagram as an image file (e.g. jpg, png, pdf) that you can post on Discourse. At a minimum, your sketch should include:
* One primary workflow including boxes for inputs, cleaning/processing steps, analysis steps, and outputs for a desired end product (e.g. plot, map, publishable data)
* One branch workflow (the processing steps for one dataset) that will produce an intermediary product needed for your desired end product (i.e. an input to the primary workflow)

### Step Three: Post on Discourse

You will work together in your group to complete this assignment.
* As a group, submit your workflow diagram to the <a href="https://earthlab.earthdatascience.org/t/about-the-week-07-data-workflow-diagram-category/196">Discourse discussion for week 7</a> being sure to list all group members in the post. **Only one diagram submission is required for each project group.** 
* Below your diagram answer the 5 questions listed above.

### Step Four: Each Group Member Should Comment on Three Other Diagrams

After all groups have submitted their workflow diagrams, **each individual member of your team** should comment on three other group submissions.

### Ask for help if you need it!

Hint: Donâ€™t be shy about reaching out to your project mentor for help and guidance as you work on this assignment.
