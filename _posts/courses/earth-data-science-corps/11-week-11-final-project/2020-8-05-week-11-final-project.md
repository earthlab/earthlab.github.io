## <i class="fa fa-ship" aria-hidden="true"></i> Welcome to Week 11

Congratulations---you've made it to the end of the Earth Data Science Corps! This week you will present and submit your final project.


## Final Project Presentations 
### Practice Presentations Friday, 8/7 10am-11:30am MT
### Final Presentations Thursday, 8/13 12-1:30pm MT

Congratulations on your progress working through the EDSC summer program! The last part of the program will include a final presentation that you will give as a group to your peers. You will get an opportunity to give your final presentation twice. 

1. First, you will give a practice presentation to your peers and mentors. Here you will get lots of feedback on what worked well and what could be improved from the group. This is a great opportunity to build your confidence in presenting.
2. In the second and final presentation, we will invite others  from Earth Lab to see how far you’ve come. You can give this presentation with confidence as you’ve already practiced the week before. 

This is separate from your final project submission assignment below.

## Presentation Sign Up

Please sign up for a presentation time slot for your group with the Google Spreadsheet by Thursday, 8/6. Place your final presentation in PowerPoint, Google Slides, PDF or whatever format you prefer in the Google Drive folder by Thursday, 8/13 at 11:30am. You do not need to submit your Practice Presentation powerpoint.

We want you to submit your presentation so we can share the slides and make the entire presentation easier for the group! 

## Presentation Requirements

Your final presentation is a summary of your final internship project. Each group will have 10 minutes to present. Please be sure to include the following in your final presentation:

* A map of the study area that you selected for your project.
* The importance of the science topic that you selected for your project.
* Your approach to addressing this topic.
* The results & conclusions of your analysis. 
* Finally - explain what is next.

Be sure to clearly articulate the significance of your project to your peers! Give this presentation as if you are speaking with a less technical audience. Everyone in this program has a different background. You can assume that your peers know the topics that we learned this summer together. However, any additional jargon or terms must be clearly defined in your presentation.

### Important Notes:
* Sign up for a presentation time slot for your group with the Google Spreadsheet by Thursday, 8/6.
* You have no more than **10 minutes** to present your project to the class.
* Each member in each group needs to present!
* You can use any presentation tool that you wish for your presentation. Powerpoint, PDF, etc.
* Drop your presentation in the Google Drive folder by Thursday, 8/13 at  11:30am


## Final Project Submission 
### Due Friday, August 14th at 10pm

In addition to your final project presentation, you will also submit: 
* The code that you used to develop your workflow in Jupyter Notebook format, and
* A blog post that describes your project.

## About the Group Blog Post

To complement your final presentation, you will write a blog post that describes your topic.

You can submit your blog post in one of the formats below: 

1. **OPTION 1**: You can choose to submit a Jupyter Notebook that contains all of your code with the associated blog write up in that notebook. By submitting this way, your entire blog post will be reproducible. If you submit a Jupyter Notebook, you may decide to submit BOTH the .ipynb file and a .html file. 
    * **The image below shows you how to export a Jupyter Notebook to html. You can use file → Download as → html**
<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/earth-analytics/edsc/export-ipynb-to-html.png" alt="Export a JupyterNotebook to HTML."></a>

2. **OPTION 2**: Alternatively - you can submit your blog post as a Word Document. This format will be less reproducible but will get the job done! Please do not hesitate to use this option.  
    * **The image below shows you how to export a Google Document as a Word Document. You can use file → Download → Microsoft Word**
<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/earth-analytics/edsc/export-google-doc.png" alt="Export a Google Doc to Word."></a>

**IMPORTANT:**
    * **You will only submit one of the two formats listed above. You can decide as a group which format you wish to use for your final blog post.** 
    * **Please be sure to include the names of ALL members of your group in your blog post as authors.** 
    * **Each group will only submit 1 blog post in either a Jupyter Notebook or Word Document format. You do not need to submit anything individually.**
    
## About Your Blog Post’s Structure

Your project blog post will be posted on our edsc page on the Earth Lab website. It should be structured as an informative online write up that describes:

1. Why your topic is important and why someone should care about it.
2. What other work has been done in this area.
3. What your methods are. Note that your code should be expressive to provide a good overview of your workflow so you do not need to get into the nitty gritty details of the Python steps that you applied.
4. Summary / Conclusions: What you discovered about your topic or research question.

Your blog should also:

1. Reference other efforts on this topic area (this could be presented as links given that it is a blog).
2. Be at least 2-3 pages of text in length (~700 words). We won't be counting words; we simply want you to create a robust blog post that describes what you did and what you found.
3. Highlight your study area using a map. 
    * OPTIONAL: Contextily could be used to create a nice basemap! You could also create a nice interactive map using Leaflet. 
4. Provide a descriptive overview of the data used with sources referenced. Note that the data sources should be described in your text. If it does not fit into your blog post you can cite the data in a short references section at the end of your blog post.
5. Provide a high level overview of the methods used to process the data. Because this is a blog post, your overview should not be technical. 
6. Present results including at least 2 data plots (graphics created using data) that answer the question that you decided to address or the phenomenon that you decided to explore using data.

IMPORTANT: Be sure to cite the data that you used in your project using the organizations preferred citation style. This citation could happen at the bottom of your post or in a figure caption!

Examples of good blog posts written by previous interns:

* <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/earthlab/2019/05/16/machine-learning-and-underwater-biomass-characterization">Machine Learning and Underwater Biomass Characterization</a>
* <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/earthlab/2020/02/07/calibrating-low-cost-air-pollution-sensors-using-machine-learning">Calibrating Low-Cost Air Pollution Sensors Using Machine Learning</a>
* <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/earthlab/2019/05/14/july-8-2016-day-hayden-pass-burned">July 8, 2016 - The Day Hayden Pass Burned</a>


## Code Submission Requirements

**Before you submit your code, please be sure that it meets the requirements below:**

* Include the code that you used to create maps and process any data used. Be sure to use expressive, efficient, modular coding. Please document your code as we have been discussing in class all summer! 
* Be sure all plots / maps have clearly labeled x and y axes (as appropriate) and legends.
* All plots / maps should also include a caption that describes what the data show. You can add the caption in whatever way you'd like to (e.g. plot caption or in the Markdown).
* All code should be formatted following pep8 guidelines.
* Spell check / grammar check your blog post BEFORE YOU SUBMIT.
* Where you can, write clean, efficient expressive code. Following what we've been discussing all semester, you will be graded on the quality of your code.
* Your notebook should run from beginning to end. Be sure to run it in its entirety before submitting and that the first cell begins at [1].

## How to Submit Your Work

To submit your final project, upload the following to Google Drive:

1. Your final presentation to this final-presentation folder on Google Drive as a PowerPoint, Google Slides, PDF, or any other presentation format.
2. Your final project blog to this final-blog folder on Google Drive as a Word Document or JupyterNotebook/HTML file. 
3. The code that you used to develop your workflow to this final-code folder on Google Drive as a Jupyter Notebook.

Please be sure to include the title of your project in each file name. **This assignment is due on Friday August 14th at 10pm.**
