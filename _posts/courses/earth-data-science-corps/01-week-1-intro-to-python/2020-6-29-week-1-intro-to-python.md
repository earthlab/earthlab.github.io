## <i class="fa fa-ship" aria-hidden="true"></i> Welcome to Week One!

Welcome to the first week the Earth Data Science Corps! This week you will be introduced to the Python programming language. 

</div>

## <i class="fa fa-pencil"></i> Homework 1: Due Next Week - Thurs, June 11 (9am MT /10am CT)

For this assignment, you will work through self-paced exercises that introduce core concepts in Python programming including:
* defining variables to store information (data values).
* creating lists (or collections) of data values.
* manipulating variables and lists to update and reorganize data.

### Readings

* Read all lessons in:
    * <a href="{{ site.url }}/courses/intro-to-earth-data-science/python-code-fundamentals/get-started-using-python/">Chapter 10: Get Started with Python Variables and Lists</a> in the Introduction to Earth Data Science online textbook. 
    * <a href="{{ site.url }}/courses/intro-to-earth-data-science/open-reproducible-science/jupyter-python/">Chapter 3: Jupyter for Python</a> in the Introduction to Earth Data Science online textbook. 

## Assignment and Submission

###  Assignment Part 1

To complete these exercises, we can encourage you to use the Jupyter Hub environment which is accessible via a web browser with an active internet connection. You can then work on setting up your local computer once you have completed the lessons.

To access these exercises on the JupyterHub:
1. Create a free GitHub account and add your name and GitHub username be granted JupyterHub access.  
2. Watch the <a href="https://earthlab.earthdatascience.org/t/how-to-log-into-jupyterhub-cloud-computing-environment/51">Intro to JupyterHub video</a> to learn how to login and access the Jupyter Notebooks.  
    * Notebooks for this assignment (and all future assignments) are accessible in the directory (folder) called course-lessons. 
    * Additional resources: 
       * <a href="{{ site.url }}/courses/intro-to-earth-data-science/open-reproducible-science/jupyter-python/">Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks</a> 
       

###  Assignment Part 2

* Post your bio to the <a href="https://earthlab.earthdatascience.org/t/meet-the-earth-data-science-corps-post-your-bio-and-meet-your-peers/20 ">Meet the Earth Data Science Corps</a> topic on Discourse.
    * After you have posted your bio, respond to three posts by <a href="https://meta.discourse.org/t/what-are-likes/30803">liking the post and replying with a comment</a> (e.g. you share similar project interests or hobbies). 
* <a href="{{ site.url }}/workshops/setup-earth-analytics-python/">Set-up the Earth Analytics Python environment on your local computer</a> 
     * Note that you can use JupyterHub (which is already set up with the tools you need) for all of your summer activities (e.g. assignments, project).
     * However, we encourage you to set up your local environment if you are able (instructions below), as this ensures that you will always have access to these tools!

### How to Submit Your Assignment
Please post a response to this <a href="https://earthlab.earthdatascience.org/t/about-the-edsc-week-01-category/75">Discourse discussion for Week 1</a>. 

### Optional: If You Want to Set Things Up Locally on your Computer
Once you have completed these exercises, you have the option to complete the <a href="https://earthlab.earthdatascience.org/t/about-the-edsc-week-01-category/75">Set-up the Earth Analytics Python environment exercise</a> (lessons 1-4) to set up the necessary tools on your local computer (Bash, git, Miniconda with Python).

After you have set-up your local environment, you can access the same Jupyter Notebooks by downloading them to your computer with the following steps:

* Fork and clone the GitHub Repository for the Earth Data Science Corps Summer program to your computer - https://github.com/earthlab/edsc-summer-2020/
    * Additional Resources:
        * <a href="{{ site.url }}/courses/intro-to-earth-data-science/open-reproducible-science/bash/">Introduction to Bash in the Terminal</a> 
        * <a href="{{ site.url }}/courses/intro-to-earth-data-science/open-reproducible-science/bash/">Copy (Fork) and Download (Clone) GitHub Repositories</a>
* Open a terminal (Git Bash on Windows or Terminal on Mac/Linux):
    * Change directories to the clone of the GitHub repository using the command *cd earth-analytics/edsc-summer-2020*
    * Activate the Earth Analytics Python environment using the command *conda activate earth-analytics-python*
    * Launch Jupyter Notebook using the command *jupyter notebook*
* Once Jupyter Notebook has launched, you can navigate to the directory (folder) called course-lessons to access the Jupyter Notebooks for this assignment.
