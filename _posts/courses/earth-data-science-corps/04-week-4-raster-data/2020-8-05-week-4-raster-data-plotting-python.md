## <i class="fa fa-ship" aria-hidden="true"></i> Welcome to Week 4

Welcome to week 4 of the Earth Data Science Corps! This week you will learn to work with raster data and plot it in Python.

</div>

## <i class="fa fa-pencil"></i> Homework 4: Due in Two Weeks - Thurs, July 9 (9am MT / 10am CT)

For this assignment, you will:
* Complete the readings below which review principles and methods for writing clean, reproducible code in Python and how you can implement them in your workflows.
* Complete Jupyter Notebooks that walk you through writing clean and reproducible code in Python.


### Readings

* Read all lessons in: 
    * <a href="{{ site.url }}/courses/use-data-open-source-python/intro-vector-data-python/spatial-data-vector-shapefiles/">Chapter 16: Write Clean Expressive Code</a> in the Introduction to Earth Data Science online textbook.  

    * <a href="{{ site.url }}/courses/use-data-open-source-python/intro-vector-data-python/vector-data-processing/">Chapter 17: Conditional Statements in Python</a> in the Introduction to Earth Data Science online textbook. 

    * <a href="{{ site.url }}/courses/use-data-open-source-python/intro-raster-data-python/fundamentals-raster-data/">Chapter 18: Loops in Python</a> in the Introduction to Earth Data Science online textbook. 

    * <a href="{{ site.url }}/courses/intro-to-earth-data-science/write-efficient-python-code/functions-modular-code/">Chapter 19: Intro to Functions in Python</a> in the Introduction to Earth Data Science online textbook. 

If you would like to follow the code in the readings, you can use the JupyterHub environment which is accessible via a web browser with an active internet connection. Recall that you need to use your GitHub account to login.  You can also use your local computer if you have successfully <a href="{{ site.url }}/workshops/setup-earth-analytics-python/">set-up your local computing environment</a>.
