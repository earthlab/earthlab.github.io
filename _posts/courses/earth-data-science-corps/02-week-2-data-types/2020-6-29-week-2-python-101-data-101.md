## <i class="fa fa-pencil"></i> Homework 2: Due Next Week

For this assignment, you will:
* Complete the readings below which review how you can use tabular data in Python to complete scientific analyses with the Pandas package.
* Complete a data scavenger hunt that will help you find and explore data related to a proposed EDSC summer project.  

### Readings

To begin, read the following chapters in the Online Textbooks - this will prepare you for next week:

* <a href="https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/intro-to-earth-data-science/scientific-data-structures-python/pandas-dataframes/">Introduction to Pandas Dataframes (Tabular Data):</a> Chapter 15 in the Introduction to Earth Data Science online textbook.  
* <a href="https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/use-data-open-source-python/use-time-series-data-in-python/date-time-types-in-pandas-python/">Introduction to Time Series with Pandas Dataframes:</a> Chapter 1 in the Intermediate Earth Data Science online textbook. 
* Videos by Corey Schafer:
    * <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyhVh-qRZPA&feature=youtu.be&t=178">Introduction to Pandas </a> (note that video link begins after the installation of Jupyter, which you already have)
    * <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFuo7EHI8zc">Introduction to Time Series with Pandas </a> (note that video link begins after the installation of Jupyter, which you already have)
    
If you would like to follow the code in the readings, you can use <a href="https://hub.earthdatascience.org/edsc-hub/hub/login">the JupyterHub environment</a> which is accessible via a web browser with an active internet connection. Recall that you need to use your GitHub account to login.  You can also use your local computer if you have successfully <a href="https://www.earthdatascience.org/workshops/setup-earth-analytics-python/">set-up your local computing environment</a>. 

### Assignment and Submission
#### Complete all Four Notebooks In the data-types Directory on the JupyterHub
To begin the assignment, be sure that you have fully worked through all four jupyter notebooks that are on the JupyterHub. The four notebooks are the ones that you began in the workshop on June 11. The fourth notebook is an activity notebook that will ask you to apply the skills that you have learned so far to complete an activity.

Once you have completed the notebooks complete the two submissions below. Both submissions below will be completed using discourse.

#### Submission Part 1 - Coding Activity
For this submission, complete notebook 04 -  04-FIXED-data-types-exercise - on the JupyterHub. Then go to the <a href="https://earthlab.earthdatascience.org/t/about-the-edsc-week-02-coding-activity-category/106">Week 2 Python Coding Assignment on Discourse</a>  and follow the instructions which ask you to post your map code and comment on other submissions. 

#### Submission Part 2 - Project Data Exploration
For this submission you will complete the Project Data Scavenger Hunt posted to the Discourse discussion for Week 2.  You can choose to work in small groups (2-3 students) if you prefer. Once you have completed the activity, please post your findings in the discussion for the <a href="https://earthlab.earthdatascience.org/t/about-the-edsc-week-02-data-scavenger-hunt-category/88">Week 2 Project Data Scavenger Hunt Category on Discourse</a>.
