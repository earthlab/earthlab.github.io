### Assignment

At this point you should be close to choosing your internship project. The activity for today and over the next week will be to create a message box, that clearly articulates:
* Issue / Topic: What is the issue that you are studying?
* Problem: What is the problem that it addresses
* So What?: Why we should care about the topic
* Benefits: What are the benefits of addressing this issue?
* Solutions: Are there any solutions or outcomes that this research could support?

Working with your group make a copy of this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rrRWwrWg9XcCjJPgZTvveeiaSw-DJsBZ8wYo1-N49R0/edit">Google Doc Template</a> and add a message box for your group.


###  Assignment Submission

When you are done creating your message template, please post it to the <a href="https://earthlab.earthdatascience.org/t/about-the-edsc-week-06-message-box-category/191">Discourse discussion for week 6</a>. You can post it as an image, table, text, or however you like.

Once you have posted, select three posts, and respond to them with feedback and questions. Each of you should provide feedback on three other group message boxes

This feedback should be constructive and include things like:
* Noting where jargon (specific technical terms that you think others may not understand) is used that they should clarify.
* Asking for clarification regarding things that are confusing.
* Mentioning anything that is interesting to you as identified in the message box.

There should be sufficient time for you to complete this activity during the workshop today.
