## <i class="fa fa-ship" aria-hidden="true"></i> Welcome to Week {{ page.week }}!

Welcome to week {{ page.week }} of Earth Analytics! In this week you will learn
approaches to communicating your science to people who are not in the same discipline
as you are.

### 2. Complete the Following

## Readings

To help you complete the class activity, read the following:

* <a href = "https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/e58a91_26905f568b1f42b78ba712ac6bb9db65.pdf" target = "_blank">Read the message box </a>
* <a href = "http://gap2.eu/methodological-toolbox/the-message-box/" target = "_blank">More on the message box from GAP</a>


## Overview

Be sure to prepare for your midterm presentation & quiz.
Your presentation will be given in class next week. The quiz will be taken
on D2L.

* [Review the midterm assignment page which contains a suggested study area list.]({{ site.url }}/courses/earth-analytics/mid-term/)

<div class="notice--warning" markdown="1">

## Class Activity (Participation Points)

At this point you should have your group project in the class google doc.

The class activity for this week will be to create a message box, that clearly articulates:

* **Issue / Topic:** What is the issue that you are studying?
* **Problem:** What is the problem that it addresses
* **So What?:** Why we (this class) should care about the topic
* **Benefits:** What are the benefits of addressing this issue?
* **Solutions:** Are there any solutions or outcomes that this research could support?

Are clearly listed in the document.

Working with your group, do the following

1. Create a new page in the google doc below. Copy the message box to that page
and fill it in as a group:

<a class="btn .btn--x-large btn-info" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1I0Ux8Z-l2xIB5df1TZ6u6K1tdAwvYKt_vqvzjegGeHI/edit" target= "_blank"> <i class="fa fa-file-text" aria-hidden="true"></i>
Message Box Google Doc (for CU Students Only) </a> then when you are happy with your message box...

2. Post your message box on piazza in the "projects" folder


3. Each of you should provide feedback on 3 other group message boxes

This feedback should be constructive and include things like:

* Noting where jargon is used that they should clarify.
* Asking for clarification regarding things that are confusing.
* Mentioning anything that is interesting to you as identified in the.

There should be sufficient time for you to complete this activity during class. However
if you miss class, or are an online student, please complete this activity by
Thursday 9 November 2017. This activity will help you with your midterm presentation
and thus should be completed PRIOR to giving your presentation!

## Mid-Term Grade Rubric


A full rubric is posted on the [midterm landing page]({{ site.url }}/courses/earth-analytics/mid-term/). In the meantime, please

1. Be sure to review the presentation on best practices at the top of this page.
2. Consider the following things as you put your talk together:

* **Presentation structure**
  * Introduction
  * Background (this should include a lit review & study area map)
  * Project importance
  * Methods
  * Example results: We know you won't have results in time for the midterm. But you should know enough about your project to know what type of results you expect to see.
* **Data:** clearly present what data you intend to use. Be sure to emphasize where you will get the data. I expect that you have looked into getting the data and even downloaded some as a test to ensure you can use it, prior to giving this talk!
* **Content:**
  * A science question that you wish to address or a phenomenon or event that you wish to better understand. It can be related to something you've learned in class or to something completely different!
  * An overview of the data types and sources that you intend to use to answer your science question.
  * An overview of the study area you will be working in.
  * An overview of what you think you'll find working on your project.
* Everyone in your group needs to present!

This is the API assignment -- it's probably not that valuable
## <i class="fa fa-pencil-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> Homework Submission


### Complete the assignment below:

This week you will create an html formatted report! We will use html in case
you'd like to embed interactive leaflet maps in your final report. Do the following:

Create a new `R markdown `document. Name it: **lastName-firstInitial-week10.Rmd**
Within your `.Rmd` document, include the plots listed below. When you are done
with your report, use `knitr` to convert it to `html` format. Submit both the
`.Rmd` file and the `.html` file to D2L. Be sure to name your files
as instructed above!

#### Use knitr code chunk arguments

For this week's assignment, you can turn off warnings but please do not hide
your code. We want to see how your code up your plots and how you access the
data.

Include the following plots in your homework:

IMPORTANT!! for all plots be sure to:

* Add a title and label the x and y axes appropriately
* Adjust the colors of your plot to make it look nice

## Homework Part 1. Answer the following questions (33%)

1. What does API stand for and what is an API?
2. Why is programmatic access to data within our code useful?
3. List 2 characteristics of the `JSON` file format.

## Homework Part 2. Create the 2 plots below (66%)

#### Plot 1

Using the tools that we learned above, import the Princeton salary data below.

Plot the following:

Experience (x axis) vs. salary (y axis). Color your points by SEX and use facets
to add a facet for each of the three ranks. Your plot should look like the
one on the bottom of [this page]( {{ site.url }}/courses/earth-analytics/week-10/get-data-with-rcurl-r/#example-homework-plot).

<a href="http://data.princeton.edu/wws509/datasets/#salary" target="_blank">Learn more about the Princeton salary data</a>

As described on the website:

> These are the salary data used in Weisberg's book, consisting of observations on six variables for 52 tenure-track professors in a small college. The variables are:

* **sx** Sex, coded 1 for female and 0 for male
* **rk** Rank, coded
  * **1** for assistant professor,
  * **2** for associate professor, and
  * **3** for full professor
* **yr** Number of years in current rank
* **dg** Highest degree, coded 1 if doctorate, 0 if masters
* **yd** Number of years since highest degree was earned
* **sl** Academic year salary, in dollars.

**HINT:** these data have a header. You will have to look up the appropriate argument
to ensure that the data import properly using `read.table()`.

**HINT2:** You can add facets or individual plots for particular subsets of data (
in this case rank) using the `facet_wrap()` argument in a ggplot plot. For example
 `+ facet_wrap(~dg)` will create a ggplot plot with sub plots filtered by highest
 degree.)

#### Plot 2

Use the `read_secure_csv_file()` function to import the gapminder data following
 [this lesson]({{ site.url }}/courses/earth-analytics/week-10/access-gapminder-data-rcurl-r/)
Then create a plot using the `ggplot()` of two variables of interest. You can
pick any variables that you want to plot together but do not use variables that
we demonstrate in the online lessons!


#### Bonus plot - (1 point)

Following the class lessons, create an interactive map showing surface water
site locations using leaflet. The map popup should include the discharge value
for each site and the station type. IMPORTANT: there is a bug where leaflet
maps don't always render properly unless you specify the tile background that
it should use! If you get a map with a grey background, this may be why!

#### Additional bonus - (1 point)

You will get a second bonus point if you can make each marker unique based on
station type!

****

## Homework due: Wednesday April 12 2017 @ NOON.
Submit your report in both `.Rmd` and `.html` format to the D2l dropbox.

NOTE: ALL future assignments will be due BEFORE CLASS on Wednesday at NOON. Following
course policy we will not accept late assignments. Start early and submit your
assignment BEFORE NOON.
