## <i class="fa fa-ship" aria-hidden="true"></i> Welcome to Week {{ page.week }}!

Welcome to week {{ page.week }} of Earth Analytics! This week, we will explore
the concept of uncertainty surrounding lidar raster data (and remote sensing
data in general).  We will use the same data that you downloaded last week for class.

## <i class="fa fa-pencil-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> Homework Submission

### Produce a .pdf report

Create a new `R markdown `document. Name it: **lastName-firstInitial-week5.Rmd**
Within your `.Rmd` document, include the plots listed below. When you are done
with your report, use `knitr` to convert it to `html` format. Submit both the
`.Rmd` file and the `.html` file. Be sure to name your files as instructed above!

#### Use knitr code chunk arguments
In your final report, use the following knitr code chunk arguments to hide messages
and warnings and code as you see fit.

* `message = FALSE`, `warning = FALSE` Hide warnings and messages in a code chunk
* `echo = FALSE` Hide code and just show code output

#### Answer the following questions below in your report
2. **Write *atleast* 2 paragraphs:** In this class we learned about lidar and canopy height models. We then compared height values extracted from a canopy height model compared to height values measured by humans at each study site. Compare the results of the scatter plots below (plots 3 and 4).
Which lidar estimate (max vs average) does a better job of comparing measured
average or max tree height ? Any ideas why one is better than the other? Discuss
this referencing what you see in the plots and the readings assigned for homework.
3. **Write *atleast* 1 paragraph:** List atleast 3 sources of uncertainty associated with the lidar derived tree heights and 3 sources of uncertainty associated with *in situ* measurements of tree height. For each source of uncertainty, specify whether it is a random or systematic error source. Be sure to reference the plots in your report when discussing this. Note: the assigned readings will help you write this paragraph.

#### Include the plots below.
Be sure to describe what each plot shows in your final report.



#### Plot 3 & 4 scatterplots
Create two scatter plots that compare:

* **MAXIMUM** canopy height model height in meters, extracted within a 20 meter radius, compared to **MAXIMUM** tree
height derived from the in situ field site data.
* **AVERAGE** canopy height model height in meters, extracted within a 20 meter radius, compared to **AVERAGE** tree
height derived from the in situ field site data.

#### Plot 5 & 6 difference bar plots
Create barplots that show the DIFFERENCE between:

* Extracted lidar max canopy height model height compared to measured max height per plot.
* Extracted lidar average canopy height model compared to measured average height per plot.

#### Graduate students only
Add a regression line to each scatterplot. For both plots write a thoughtful paragraph
describing what the regression relationship tells you about the relationship
between lidar and measured vegetation height. Does the comparison between lidar and
measured average height look stronger? Or Maximum height? Why might one be "better"
or a strong relationship than the other.

### IMPORTANT: for all plots
* Label x and y axes appropriately - include units
* Add a title to your plot that describes what the plot shows
* Add a 2-3 sentence caption below each plot that describes what it shows HINT: you can use the knitr argument fig.cap="Caption here" if you are knitting to pdf to automatically add captions.

## Homework due: Friday Feb 24 2017 @ noon.
Submit your report in both `.Rmd` and `.pdf` format to the D2l dropbox.

## .pdf Report structure & code: 10%

|  Full Credit | Partial Credit ~B | Partial Credit ~C | Partial Credit ~D | No Credit|
|---|---|---|---|---|
| PDF and RMD submitted |  | Only one of the 2 files are submitted  | | No files submitted |
| Code is written using "clean" code practices following the Hadley Wickham style guide| Spaces are placed after all # comment tags, variable names do not use periods, or function names. | Clean coding is used in some of the code but spaces or variable names are incorrect 2-4 times| | Clean coding is not implemented consistently throughout the report. |
| Code chunk contains code and runs  | All code runs in the document  | There are 1-2 errors in the code in the document that make it not run | | The are more than 3 code errors in the document |
| All required R packages are listed at the top of the document in a code chunk.  | | Some packages are listed at the top of the document and some are lower down. | | |
| Lines of code are broken up at commas to make the code more readable  | |  | | |

| Student compared the scatter plots of average and max height and determined which relationship is "better" (more comparable)|  |  | | |
| Student references what they see in the scatter plots and the difference bar plots to make their argument for which relationships (average height vs max height) is better. The argument is based upon data results and what they learned in the readings / class. |  |  | | |
| 1-2 readings from the homework are referenced in this paragraph.|  |  | | |
| 3 sources of uncertainty associated with the lidar derived tree heights and the in situ measurements of tree height are discussed in the homework. |||||
| The sources of uncertainty either reference the readings or are other sources discussed in class or observed by the student. |||||
