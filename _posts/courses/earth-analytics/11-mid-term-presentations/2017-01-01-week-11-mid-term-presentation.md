### Complete the assignment below:

For this week you will review *atleast* 4 other presentations during
class. Please submit your review to qualtrics using the link below. Please
be sure to add your first and last name and email to the qualtrics form so we can
count your review when we grade!

FOR COURSE STUDENTS ONLY: Qualtrics Survey  - Use this to Submit your review to me by Tuesday at 8pm. </a>

Because you may want to revise your review before submitting it to us and your classmates,
we created a google doc that you can use to take notes during class.  You don't have
to use it. We just thought it might be helpful.

FOR COURSE STUDENTS ONLY: Google doc evaluation form template - use this if you'd like as an example of what the qualtrics form above looks like. You will submit your evaluation through qualtrics. </a>


#### BONUS (1 Point):
Review atleast 2 additional presentations to receive an additional homework point.


### Participation
Because we won't have a lot of time for questions after each presentation, please
leave any questions that you have for a group in piazza under the groups name.
The group can then see your question and answer them!

Please also be sure to ANSWER any questions that are asked of your group. Asking
and answering questions will count towards your participation grade for this week.
