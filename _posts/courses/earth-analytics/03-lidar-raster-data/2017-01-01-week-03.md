## <i class="fa fa-ship" aria-hidden="true"></i> Welcome to Week {{ page.week }}!

Welcome to week {{ page.week }} of Earth Analytics! In week 3 you will learn about
Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data. You will learn to use point cloud data and
lidar rasters in `R` and explore using QGIS - a free, open-source GIS tool.

Your final 2013 Colorado flood report assignment is below. Read the assignment
carefully and make sure you've completed all of the steps and followed all of the
guidelines. Use all of the class and homework lessons that you've learned in the
first few weeks to help you complete the assignment.

## <i class="fa fa-pencil-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> Homework (10 points): Due Monday Sept 25 @ 8AM

#### Produce a Final Report on the 2013 Floods

Create a new `R markdown `document. Name it: **lastName-firstInitial-floodreport.Rmd**
Within your `.Rmd` document, carefully compose a report that summarizes what you have
learned about the 2013 Colorado flood event. Use all of the plots that you have created
in the first 3 weeks of the class in your report as listed below.

When you are done with your report, use `knitr` to convert it to `html` format (note:
if you did not get `knitr` working it is ok if you create an html document and
export it to html as demonstrated in class). You will submit both
the `.Rmd` file and the `.html` file. Be sure to name your files as instructed above!

Include the following parts in your report:

####  Background / Overview of the Flood

Include the following background in your report:

1. Description of where and when the disturbance event occurred.
2. Discussion of the drivers that yielded the flooding in Boulder and discussion of the impacts of the flood.

#### Your Report Should Include 9 Plots
Your report should include the following plots (in whatever order you think best
describes the events of the flood):

### Basemap Plot:

* **PLOT 1:** A basemap showing the location of the stream gage / study area created using
`ggmap()` (or the maps package if `ggmap` doesn't work on your computer). Use the <a href="{{ site.url }}/courses/earth-analytics/lidar-raster-data-r/">ggmap / maps lesson to guide creating this plot.</a>

### Precip & Discharge Plots from Week 2:

Use the `data/week-02/precipitation/805325-precip-dailysum-2003-2013.csv`file to create:

* **PLOT 2:** a plot of precipitation from 2003 to 2013 using `ggplot()`.
* **PLOT 3:** a plot that shows precipitation SUBSETTED from Aug 15 - Oct 15 2013 using `ggplot()`.

Use the `data/week-02/discharge/06730200-discharge-daily-1986-2013.csv` file to create:

* **PLOT 4:** a plot of stream discharge from 1986 to 2016 using `ggplot()`.
* **PLOT 5:** a plot that shows stream discharge SUBSETTED from Aug 15 - Oct 15 2013 using `ggplot()`.

### Raster & Histogram Plots from Week 3:

* **PLOT 6: pre/post CHM difference raster histogram** Create a **cropped** raster map that shows positive and negative change in the canopy height model before and after the flood. To do this:
   * Subtract the post-flood CHM from the pre-flood CHM (**pre_flood_CHM - post_flood_CHM**).
   * Crop the data using the `data/week-03/BLDR_LeeHill/clip-extent.shp` crop_extent shapefile.
   * Plot a histogram of the cropped data.

* **PLOT 7: Classified pre/post CHM difference raster** Use the difference raster that you created above and the histogram as a guide to classify your difference canopy height model. Use values that make sense after reviewing the histogram.

* **PLOT 8: pre/post DTM difference raster histogram** Create a **cropped** raster map that shows positive and negative change in the digital terrain model before and after the flood. To do this:
   * Subtract the post-flood DTM from the pre-flood DTM (**pre_flood_DTM - post_flood_DTM**).
   * Crop the data using the `data/week-03/BLDR_LeeHill/clip-extent.shp` crop_extent shapefile.
   * Plot a histogram of the cropped data.
* **PLOT 9: Classified pre/post DTM difference raster** Use the difference raster that you created above and the histogram as a guide to classify your difference digital terrain model. Use values that make sense after reviewing the histogram.


### Graduate Students Only - Use Bookdown to Add Citations

* Use `bookdown` and `knitr` to add citations to your report. <a href="http://earthdatascience.org/courses/earth-analytics/document-your-science/add-citations-to-rmarkdown-report/">This tutorial will help you complete this part of the assignment.</a>

For all plots use the readings from the last 3 weeks to discuss:

* Where the data came from and what the data shows.
* Discuss patterns that are evident in the data and potential relationships between what you see in the lidar data compared to precipitation and discharge.


#### Summary / Discussion
End your report with a summary discussion of the flood events. Be sure to discuss
how the data help you better understand the 2013 Colorado floods as they
impacted Boulder, Colorado.


#### Important:

* Clearly state the source of each dataset that you use to create the plot in your report text.
* Make sure each plot has a clear **TITLE** and, where appropriate, **label the x and y axes**. Be sure to include **UNITS** in your labels!
* Analyze / interpret each plot that you produce in your report. State what the source of the data are and what the plot shows as a driver or impact of the 2013 flood events.
* Clearly document that steps that you took to process the data by commenting your code or in the text of your report itself as it makes sense.
* All students must cite **at least 3** articles that you read or other sources of information that you used to write your report. (grad students will use `bookdown` to do this, undergrads can choose how they want to include citations).
* Use clean coding practices - this includes comments, variable names that are informative, clean code spacing, following Hadley Wickham's code style guide.
* Make sure all of the libraries that you use in the report are listed in a code chunk at the TOP of your document.
* Spell check your report and check grammar.
* All plots should be clearly labeled with titles, and x and y axis labels are it makes sense. (Your map of lidar data doesn't need x and y labels).
* Be sure to discuss how you selected the classification values used in the raster plots referencing
the histograms of the data that you create.
* OPTIONAL BONUS: Include images as they make sense. Be sure to cite any graphics that you use that are not yours.


## Submissions
Submit your report in **both** `.Rmd` and `.html` format to the D2L dropbox.
NOTE: if you want to create `.pdf` formatted reports that is fine as well!
You may need to google formatting associated with pdfs!
</div>


## Homework Plots

The plots below are examples of what your plots might look like. Your plot does
not need to look exactly like these! You may use different classes for your
different maps for example which will change your rasters! Feel free to
customize colors, labels, layers, etc are you'd like to create nice plots.

To specify the data source in the ggplot maps below, I've used the `caption = `
argument in the `labs()` function:

```r
labs(title = "your title here",
     caption = "data source text here")
```

You could also add the data source in your figure cation by adding the following
code to your code chunk:

```r
{r chunk-name, fig.cap = "caption here that could include the data source"}
```

How you approach adding captions to your report is up to you!

### Plots 7 & 9 - Histograms

* **Plot 7:** A histogram raster map that shows positive and negative change in CHM derived from the pre and post flood Canopy Height Models.
* **Plot 9:** A histogram raster map that shows positive and negative change in terrain derived from the pre and post flood Digital Terrain Models.

A histogram of the classified raster layer that shows positive and negative change in canopy height derived from the pre and post flood Digital Terrain Models before and after the flood
