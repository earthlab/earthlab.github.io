Landsat data are often saved using a date that includes the year and the day of
year. You can quickly convert day of year to date as follows:

Here is our file name:

`LC80340322016189-SC20170128091153`

Looking at the name, we can see that the data were collected 2016-189. This
references the 189th day of the year in 2016.

We can quickly convert this in `R`:



```r
# note that R uses a 0 based index for dates only
# this means it starts counting at 0 rather than 1 when working with dates
as.Date(0, origin = "2016-01-01")
## [1] "2016-01-01"
# note that R uses a 0 based index
as.Date(1, origin = "2016-01-01")
## [1] "2016-01-02"

# figure out the date for day 189
as.Date(189, origin = "2016-01-01")
## [1] "2016-07-08"
```
