Welcome to Week {{ page.week }} of Earth Analytics! This week we will explore the
Colorado information warehouse SOCRATA API together in class. If you remember
it did not work properly in class last week. I have rewritten the lessons and we
will review how the API works and API access in general. We will spend the rest
of the class working on your group project.
