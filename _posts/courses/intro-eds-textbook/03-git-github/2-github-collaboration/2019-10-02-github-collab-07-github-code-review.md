## About Code Reviews

A **code review** is a way for you to suggest changes
to another person's pull request. You can send comments back and
forth referencing specific lines of code. Code
reviews are used to let contributors know what they need to do before
their pull request meets project standards and is ready to merge.

## The Code Review Workflow
As a reminder, when you open up a pull request, you will see the line by line changes or
differences between the file you submitted, compared to the file that exists
in a repository. These changes are called **diffs** (short for differences).

Pull requests show diffs of the content between (a branch on) your repository and (a
branch on) the repository that you are submitting changes to. 

The changes, additions,
and subtractions are shown in green and red. The color green represents additions
to the file whereas red represents deletions.

To leave a code review:

1. Go to the pull request page.
2. Click on the **Files Changed** tab. You should now be able to see the diff

3. Look through the changes. If you want to make a general comment you can click the green **Review changes** button and add then leave your comment as a code review.

3. If there is a *particular line* you want to comment on, mouse over the left edge of the line. A blue plus sign will pop up.

4. Once you have written your comment, you can choose to **Add single comment** or **Start a review**. If you start a review, then all subsequent comments will be added to your review until you are finished.
