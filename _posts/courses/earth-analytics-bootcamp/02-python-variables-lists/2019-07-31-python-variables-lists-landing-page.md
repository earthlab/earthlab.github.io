## <i class="fa fa-ship" aria-hidden="true"></i> Welcome to Day Two!

Welcome to Day Two of the Earth Analytics Bootcamp! Today, you will learn about `Python` variables (which store single data values) and lists (which can store many data values). Specifically, you will write `Python` code to create and manipulate variables and lists, and you will also write `Python` code to plot data using the `matplotlib` package. 


## <i class="fa fa-graduation-cap" aria-hidden="true"></i> Learning Objectives

After completing the lessons for Day 2, you will be able to:

* Define a variable and explain how variables are used in `Python`
* Write `Python` code to create variables and run arithmetic calculations on them
* Write `Python` code to create and edit lists
* Write `Python` code to plot data using the `matplotlib` package
