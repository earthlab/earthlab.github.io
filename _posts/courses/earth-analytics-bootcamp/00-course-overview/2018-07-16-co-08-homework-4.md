## <i class="fa fa-ship" aria-hidden="true"></i> Homework 4

For this assignment, you will create a `Jupyter Notebook` with your answers to the questions below, and submit this `Jupyter Notebook` to a Github repository for Homework 4 following the instructions below **Part II: Submit Your Jupyter Notebook to GitHub**. 

You need to **complete this assignment (Homework 4) by Tuesday, August 21st at 8:00 AM (U.S. Mountain Daylight Time)**. See <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20180821T08&p1=1243" target="_blank">this link</a> to convert the due date/time to your local time.

This assignment will primarily test your skills to notify others of pull requests on `Github.com`  from Day 9 and to write functions from Day 10. Your skills will loops from Day 7 and conditional statements from Day 8 will also be reviewed.

You will be asked to work with familiar data: <a href="https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/boulder/Boulder.mm.html" target="_blank">temperature</a> and <a href="https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/boulder/Boulder.mm.precip.html" target="_blank">precipitation</a> for various months and years of data for  Boulder, Colorado, provided by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).


## <i class="fa fa-check-square-o fa-2" aria-hidden="true"></i> What You Need

Be sure that you have completed all of the lessons from Days 7 to 10 for the Earth Analytics Bootcamp. Completing the challenges at the end of the lessons will also help you with this assignment. Review the lessons as needed to answer the questions.   

You will need to **`fork` and `clone` a Github repository for Homework 4** from `https://github.com/earthlab-education/ea-bootcamp-hw-4-yourusername`. You will receive an invitation to the Github repository for Homework 4 via CANVAS. 

Note: the repository will be empty, as you will add a new `Jupyter Notebook` containing your answers to the questions below. 

</div>


## Part I: Create and Modify a Jupyter Notebook

Begin by creating a new `Jupyter Notebook` in your forked repository from `https://github.com/yourusername/ea-bootcamp-hw-4-yourusername`. 

Rename the file to `firstinitial-lastname-ea-bootcamp-hw-4.ipynb` (e.g. `jpalomino-ea-bootcamp-hw-4.ipynb`). 

Note that `Git` will recognize this new `Jupyter Notebook` as a new file that can be added, committed, and pushed back to your forked repository on `Github.com`. 


### Be Sure to Add Documentation to Your Notebook (4 pts)

Start with `Markdown` cell containing a `Markdown` title for this assignment, plus an author name and date in list form. Bold the words for author and date, but do not bold your name and today's date. 

**Add a `Markdown` cell before each code cell** you create to describe the purpose of your code (e.g. what are you accomplishing by executing this code?). Think carefully about how many cells you should have to best organize your data (hint: review lessons for examples of how code can be grouped into cells).

Within code cells, **be sure to also add `Python` comments to document each code block** and **use the PEP 8 guidelines to assign appropriate variable names** that are short and concise but also clearly indicate the kind of data contained in the variable. 


### Be Sure to Document Functions and Assign Clear Function Names (8 pts)

In this assignment, you will be asked to write several functions. 

Be sure to add documentation within your functions using `Python` comments to tell the user what the function is doing and and what inputs it can take. 

Also, be sure to use clear function names that tell the user what the function does. If you find it useful, you can review the <a href="{{ site.url }}/courses/earth-analytics-bootcamp/pep-8-style-guide/">Earth Analytics Bootcamp reference page on PEP8 Style Guide</a>. 


### Question 1: Import Python Packages (2 pts)

In the questions below, you will be working with `numpy arrays`. 

You will also be downloading files using `urllib.request` and accessing directories and files on your computer using `os`. Last, you will also be creating plots of your data.

Import all of the necessary `Python` packages to accomplish these tasks.

### Question 2: Download CSV Files and Import Into Numpy Arrays (2 pts)

Use `.urllib.request` to download the following .csv files of monthly precipitation (millimeters) and temperature (Celsius) - notice the units this time:

1. `monthly-precip-mm-1998-to-2017.csv` from `https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/12799931`

2. `monthly-temp-cel-1998-to-2017.csv` from `https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/12799928`

Each dataset contains a row for each year specified in the dataset name and contains a column for each month (starting with January through December). 

Use the appropriate function to import the files into new `numpy arrays`. 

Print your `numpy arrays` using the appropriate code to suppress the scientific notation. 

**Note:** you are not required to write a loop to accomplish this task. You can follow the same process that you have before to download and import files.

### Question 3: Write Loop to Check Dimensions of Numpy Arrays (4 pts)

Write a loop to print the following information for each numpy array from the previous question:

1. number of rows and columns
2. number of dimensions (as a single value)

Hints:
* You have a fixed number of items that you want upon which you want iterate the same code (i.e. the two `numpy arrays` you previously created).
* There are two attributes of `numpy arrays` that you can use to get this information.


{:.output}
    shape: (20, 12)
    number of dimensions: 2
    
    shape: (20, 12)
    number of dimensions: 2
    



### Question 4: Write Function to Convert Units (6 pts)

Imagine you work for NOAA, which you know publishes their precipitation data in inches, rather than millimeters. You have received new data in millimeters, so you need to convert these values to match your other NOAA datasets.

Write a function to convert the units of a `numpy array` from millimeters to inches (`one inch = 25.4 millimeters`). (Note you will execute it in the next question.)

Be sure to add documentation within your functions using `Python` comments to tell the user what the function is doing and and what inputs it can take. 

### Question 5: Apply Function and Save Output to New Numpy Array (4 pts)

Run your function on the `numpy array` created from `monthly_precip_mm_1998-to-2017.csv` to convert the units from millimeters to inches. 

Save the output as a new `numpy array` and print the `numpy array`.

### Question 6: Write Function to Convert Units (8 pts)

Imagine you work for NOAA, which you know publishes their temperature data in Fahrenheit, rather than Celsius. You have received new data in Celsius, so you need to convert these values to match your other NOAA datasets.

Write a function to convert the units of a `numpy array` from Celsius to Fahrenheit (`Fahrenheit = (Celsius * 1.8) + 32`). (Note you will execute it in the next question.)

Be sure to add documentation within your functions using `Python` comments to tell the user what the function is doing and and what inputs it can take. 

### Question 7: Apply Function and Save Output to New Numpy Array (4 pts)

Run your function on the `numpy array` created from `monthly_temp_cel_1998-to-2017.csv` to convert the units from Celsius to Fahrenheit. 

Save the output as a new `numpy array` and print the `numpy array`.

2. Why does the `numpy array` you created for temperature in Question 12 contain the number of values that it contains? What does each value in this `numpy array` represent?

### Question 14: Create Manual Numpy Array (2 pts)

Manually create a `numpy array` that contains the month names for January to December. Print your `numpy array` using `print()` to only see the values it contains.

Hints:
* Review the practice with data structures activity to review how to create a `numpy array` manually.
* You will want to use the quotes `"text"` to create the month names


{:.output}
    ['January' 'February' 'March' 'April' 'May' 'June' 'July' 'August'
     'September' 'October' 'November' 'December']



### Question 15: Write Conditional Statement to Check Dimensions (4 pts)

Write a conditional statement to check that the dimensions are the same between the `numpy array` created for temperature in Question 12 and your `numpy array` containing the month names created in Question 14. 

Using your conditional statement, print a message stating whether or not the dimensions are the same, so that you can plot these `numpy arrays` together. 

Hint:
* Compare the shape of the arrays, rather than the single value for the dimension. 
* Recall the operator to check equality between two values. 


{:.output}
    These arrays have the same shape and can be plotted together.



### Question 16: Plot Your Numpy Arrays (4 pts)

Create a plot of your choosing to display your data from the `numpy array` created for temperature in Question 12 and your `numpy array` containing the month names created in Question 14. 

Be sure to add a title and label the axes with the appropriate units. 

For the title, think carefully about what this data is actually showing. Review your code that created this temperature array, so that you can title the plot appropriately. 


{:.output}
{:.display_data}

### Question 17: Practice Pseudo Coding (10 pts)

1. Without using too much jargon, make a list of all of the steps that you had to complete prior to creating the plot for Question 16. (FYI - this is pseudo-coding! Identifying the steps needed in order to write and automate your code.)
    * Begin your list with the conversion of the temperature data from Celsius to Fahrenheit and end it with checking that the dimensions between the `numpy arrays` were the same, so you could plot.
    
    
2. How could use functions to more easily accomplish the goal of creating the final plot? (Note: describe in words. You are not being asked to create a function to do this.) 


3. Identifying what you do not already know is also very important in pseudo-coding a workflow. 
    * With this in mind, do you think it would be possible to create one function that accomplishes all of the steps listed in subquestion 1?
    * What would you need to know how to do, in order to write one function that completed all of the steps?
