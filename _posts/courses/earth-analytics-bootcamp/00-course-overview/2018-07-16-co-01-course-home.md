## About the Earth Analytics Bootcamp
The Earth Analytics Bootcamp is a three-week introductory-level course taught by instructors in Earth Lab and is a part of the <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/earthlab/earth-data-analytics-foundations-professional-certificate" target="_blank">Professional Certificate in Earth Data Analytics - Foundations</a> at CU Boulder.

In this course, you will learn how to analyze and visualize earth and environmental science data using the `Python` programming language. You will also learn how to design and implement open reproducible science workflows using `Bash`/`Shell`, `Git`/`Github.com`, and `Jupyter Notebook`. 

### Course Overview 
This course is highly technical, and you will code every day. We will use the `Python` scientific programming environment and the `Jupyter Notebook` graphical interface to work with data.

<i fa fa-star></i>**Important:** We have a cloud environment (`Jupyter Hub`) available for you to use for your assignments. However, we encourage you to get `Python` set up on your own computer as well, as it's a good skill to have! You will also need to have `Bash` and `Git` installed on your computer for several activities in this course. Please follow the instructions on <a href="{{ site.url }}/workshops/setup-earth-analytics-python/setup-git-bash-anaconda/" target = "_blank">Setting up Git, Bash, and Anaconda on your computer</a> to install the necessary tools for your operating system (Windows, Mac, Linux).
