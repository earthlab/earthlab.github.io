## Course Overview

This introductory, multidisciplinary course will provide core scientific programming skills required to efficiently work with a suite of earth systems data in `Python`. 

In this course, you will learn how to: 
* Write modular code using `Python` to process and visualize different types of data.
* Use version control to backup and track changes to code. 
* Use `Shell` to access `Git` (version control) at the command line and to create and organize directories.

You will also learn how to work collaboratively with colleagues using Git and Github.

This course is technical. You will use the `Python` programming environment and the `Jupyter Notebook` interface to work with data. You will code every day! No programming experience is required to take this course.


## Course Schedule and Topics

The course format is a condensed to 3 weeks following the CU Augmester schedule. The following topics will be presented over the course of that time.
* Introduction to the command line interface (CLI) - use `Bash`/`Shell` to navigate your computer directory structure, create directories and interface with `Git`
* Use `Git` and `Github.com` to track changes to text files and code. 
* Introduction to `Jupyter Notebook` and the `Python` programming language. 
* Write modular efficient code in `Python` using functions and loops.
* Write pseudocode to organize and outline workflows

The course will culminate with a project rather than a final exam.

## Communication

All email messages about this course should include `earth-analytics-bootcamp` in the subject line and be signed with your full name. Please use your official **CU email address** when communicating with your course instructors.

If your email is not personal in nature, but rather a question about the homework, issues with the course website, or issues with Python, please:
1. See if the question has already been asked on Piazza
2. If the question hasn’t already been asked, please post your question to PIAZZA.

### About Piazza

This semester you will use Piazza for class discussion. Piazza will help you get help faster and more efficiently from classmates and myself. Rather than emailing questions to us, **post your questions on Piazza.**

1. To get started, be sure to create an account with piazza. You will use this tool on the first day of class, so please do this ahead of time.

2. You will receive an invitation to join <a href="https://piazza.com/colorado/summer2018/earthanalyticsbootcamp/home" target="_blank">Piazza webpage for this course</a>, once you have enrolled and a few days prior to the course begins. Please email the instructor to get access to Piazza if you don’t have it by the first day of class.


### Piazza Rules 

It is important that you follow the course guidelines when posting to Piazza.

Do:
* Post questions that you have about homework assignments
* Post issues that you find with the website – typos, errors, points of confusion
* Answer other questions if you can (you will receive participation points for posting on piazza so use it)
* Upvote questions that you have as well or that you think are written well
* Be respectful of your peers. All questions related to data and earth analytics are good questions.

Do not:
* Post any content that is in any way offensive or that violates University codes of conduct (see links below)
* Post explicit solutions to homework assignments (help each other out but don’t post the answer)
* Post an entire homework document on Piazza - rather post a small snippet of code that is causing problems and the associated code error

When posting questions about coding issues to Piazza, please do your best to provide an example of the specific code error that you are encountering.

Example. The code
```
read.cs("filename")
```

returns this error:
```
error here
```
In the example above, the fix would be to make sure your function name is correct.

## Course Content
