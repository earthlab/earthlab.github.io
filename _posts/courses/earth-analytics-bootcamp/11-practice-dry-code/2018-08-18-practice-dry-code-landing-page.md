## <i class="fa fa-ship" aria-hidden="true"></i> Welcome to Day Eleven!

Welcome to Day Eleven of the Earth Analytics Bootcamp! Today, you will practice using the DRY code strategies that you have learned in this course: loops, conditional statements, and functions. You will also practice working with `numpy arrays` and `pandas dataframes`. Rather than reviewing lessons, you will complete a hands-on activity. 


## <i class="fa fa-graduation-cap" aria-hidden="true"></i> Learning Objectives

By completing the activity for today, you will practice:

* Selecting data from and checking the dimensions of `numpy arrays`
* Writing loops, conditional statements and functions
* Running loops on `pandas dataframes` and columns in `pandas dataframes`
* Writing pseudo-code to outline workflows and identify gaps in knowledge

You will also learn how to:

* Flatten two-dimensional `numpy arrays` to one-dimensional `numpy arrays`
* Run functions within conditional statements
