## <i class="fa fa-ship" aria-hidden="true"></i> Hands-on Practice Writing DRY Code

This hands-on activity provides you an opportunity to practice working with the DRY code strategies introduced in this course: loops, conditional statements, and functions.

While this activity will not be formally graded, you can **earn participation points** for submitting your completed `Jupyter Notebook` for this activity.


## <i class="fa fa-check-square-o fa-2" aria-hidden="true"></i> What You Need

Be sure that you have completed all of the lessons from Days 4-10 for the Earth Analytics Bootcamp. Completing the challenges at the end of the lessons will also help you with this assignment. 

You will need to **`fork` and `clone` a Github repository for this activity**: 

`https://github.com/earthlab-education/ea-bootcamp-practice-dry-code`

</div>


## Part I: Create and Modify a Jupyter Notebook

Begin by creating a new `Jupyter Notebook` in your forked repository (`ea-bootcamp-practice-dry-code`). 

Rename the file to `firstinitial-lastname-practice-dry-code.ipynb` (e.g. `jpalomino-practice-dry-code.ipynb`). 

Note that `Git` will recognize this new `Jupyter Notebook` as a new file that can be added, committed, and pushed back to your forked repository on `Github.com`. 


### Practice Documentation of Code and Functions

Start with `Markdown` cell containing a `Markdown` title for this assignment, plus an author name and date in list form. Bold the words for author and date, but do not bold your name and today's date. 

Add a `Markdown` cell before each code cell you create to describe the purpose of your code (e.g. what are you accomplishing by executing this code?). 

**Be sure to add documentation within your functions** using `Python` comments to tell the user what the function is doing and and what inputs it can take. 

Also, be sure to use clear function names that tell the user what the function does. If you find it useful, you can review the <a href="{{ site.url }}/courses/earth-analytics-bootcamp/pep-8-style-guide/">Earth Analytics Bootcamp reference page on PEP8 Style Guide</a>.


### Import Python Packages

In the questions below, you will be working with `numpy arrays` and `pandas dataframes`. 

You will also be downloading files using `urllib.request` and accessing directories and files on your computer using `os`. Last, you will also be creating plots of your data.

Import all of the necessary `Python` packages to accomplish these tasks.

### Get Data

#### Numpy Arrays

Use `.urllib.request` to download the following .csv files of monthly precipitation (inches) and  import the data to `numpy arrays`:

1. `monthly-precip-1988-to-1992.csv` from `https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/12807380`

2. `monthly-precip-1993-to-1997.csv` from `https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/12807383`

Each dataset contains a row for each year specified in the dataset name and contains a column for each month (starting with January through December). 

#### Pandas Dataframes

Use `.urllib.request` to download the following .csv files of monthly temperature (Fahrenheit) and import the data to `pandas dataframes`:

1. `temp-1991-to-1995-months.csv` from `https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/12807389`

2. `temp-1996-to-2000-months.csv` from `https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/12807386`

Each dataset contains a row for each year specified in the dataset name and a column for each month (starting with January through December). 

**Note:** you are not required to write a loop to accomplish these tasks. You can follow the same process that you have before to download and import files.

### Question 1: Use Indexing to Select from Numpy Array

Select the second row of data (including all columns) from the `numpy array` containing the data for 1988 to 1992, and save to a new `numpy array`.

Note that using an index series (e.g. `[row_index:row_index, column_index:column_index]`) to select the rows and columns will result in a two-dimensional array. 

Name your new array appropriately to indicate the year of data that it represents. 


{:.output}
{:.execute_result}



    array([[1.19, 1.27, 0.97, 1.95, 2.68, 2.93, 1.43, 1.63, 3.54, 1.4 , 0.09,
            1.54]])





### Question 2: Write a Conditional Statement to Check Dimensions of Numpy Array

Write a conditional statement that checks whether the `numpy array` created in the previous question (i.e. the selection) is a one-dimensional `numpy array`. 

Print a message stating whether or not the array is one-dimensional.

Hints:
* It is easier to write this conditional statement using the attribute of `numpy arrays` that provides a single value for the dimension (i.e. `.ndim`), rather than the shape.
* Recall how to use the comparison operator to check for equality between values (`==`). 


{:.output}
    This is NOT a one-dimensional array.



### Question 3: Expand Conditional Statement to Execute Different Code 

Modify your conditional statement from the previous question, so that your `if` and `else` statements execute different code, not just printing messages.

For the `if` statement, rather than printing a message, print the shape of the `numpy array` from the previous question (i.e. the selection). 

For the `else` statement, rather than printing a message, include the following code lines to be executed (i.e. if the array is not one-dimensional):  
* `arrayname_1d = arrayname.flatten()`
* `print(arrayname_1d.shape)` 

These code lines will flatten a `numpy array` (in this case named `arrayname`) to a one-dimensional array, save it to a new array called `arrayname_1d`, and print the shape of the new array.

**Note the result of this conditional statement.** 


{:.output}
    (12,)



### Question 4: Write a Conditional Statement to Check Dimensions of Two Numpy Arrays

Manually create a one-dimensional `numpy array` that contains the month names (i.e. January to December).

Write a conditional statement to check that this new array for month names has the **same shape** as the `numpy array` from the previous question (i.e. the selection). 

Print a message stating whether are not these arrays have the same shape and can be plotted together.

Hints:
* Review the Activity on Data Structures from Day 6 if you need to recall how to manually create a `numpy array` using `np.array([])`.  
* Note that you are creating this new array using text strings, not numeric values. 
* Recall how to use the comparison operator to check for equality between values (`==`).


{:.output}
    These arrays have the same shape and can be plotted together.



### Question 5: Practice Pseudo Coding

Reflect on your conditional statement from the previous question. 

Write a sentence or two on how you could expand on your conditional statement from the previous question to create a plot from the two `numpy arrays` if they do indeed have the same shape. 

Hint: what did you do in Question 3 to expand on your conditional statement?

### Question 6: Loop on Pandas Dataframes

Write a loop to run the `info()` method on the two `pandas dataframes` that you imported in this activity, and print the results. 

Hint:
* Recall that creating a list of items to iterate upon is a good first step to writing a loop. 
* Think about what you are iterating upon in this question - do your list values need `""` to indicate text strings, or are you iterating on existing variables?

### Question 7: Loop on Columns in Pandas Dataframes

Write a loop to run the `.describe()` method on each column in the pandas dataframe containing the data for 1996 to 2000).

Hint: 
* Recall that creating a list of items to iterate upon is a good first step to writing a loop. 
* Think about what you are iterating upon in this question - do your list values need `""` to indicate text strings, or are you iterating on existing variables?
* Recall that to select columns in `pandas dataframes` using implicit variables (i.e. not explicitly created by you), change the syntax from `dataframe.column_name` to `dataframe[[column_name]]`.

### Question 8: Write Function to Summarize Numpy Array Using Axes

Write a function that calculates the mean across columns of a `numpy array`.

Hints: 
* Recall which existing `numpy` function you can use to calculate a mean. You will include this function within the function you write to answer this question.  
* Review the lessons on functions to see the use of axes to calculate a statistic across the rows or columns of a `numpy array`.

### Question 9: Execute Function and Save Output to New Numpy Array

Run the function created in the previous question (i.e. to calculate mean of columns in a `numpy array`) on the `numpy array` containing data for 1993 to 1997. Save the output to a new `numpy array`.


{:.output}
{:.execute_result}



    array([0.902, 1.184, 1.608, 3.746, 3.898, 2.96 , 1.114, 2.19 , 2.444,
           1.402, 1.776, 0.468])





### Question 10: Practice Pseudo Coding

You have already learned how to save the output from one run of a function (see Question 9). What if you wanted to run the function on multiple `numpy arrays`?

**Write a sentence or two on what you would need to know how to do, in order to save the output from a function that is running on multiple arrays in a loop.**

Hint: think about how you can append values to a list using a loop (i.e. create an empty list that gets values appended to it in the loop).
