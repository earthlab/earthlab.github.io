## Watch Video About the Importance of Reproducibility in Science

First, watch a short video to learn more about the importance of reproducibility and the current reproducibility "crisis" in science.

## Useful Tools in the Open Reproducible Science Toolbox

Open reproducible science results from open science workflows that allow you to easily collaborate with others and openly publish your workflows to contribute to greater science knowledge.

To implement open science workflows, you need tools that help you document and share various aspects of your workflow, such as the details of the data collection or your code for data analysis. 

While there are many tools that support open reproducible science, you will learn how to implement open science workflows in this course using: `Shell`, `Git`/`Github.com`, and `Python` using `Jupyter Notebook`. 


### Shell

`Shell` is the primary program that computers use to receive code (i.e. commands) and return information produced by executing these commands (i.e. output). These commands can be entered via a `Terminal` (i.e. Command Line Interface - CLI), which you will work with in this course. 

Using `Shell` helps you to:
* easily navigate your computer to access and manage files and folders (i.e. directories) 
* quickly and efficiently work with many files and directories at once
* run programs that provide more functionality at the command line (e.g. the `Git` tool suite)
* launch programs from specific directories on your computer (e.g. `Jupyter Notebook` for interactive programming)
* use repeatable commands for these tasks across many different operating systems (Windows, Mac, Linux)

In this course, you will learn how to use `Shell` to access and manage files on your computer and to run other programs that can be started or run from the `Terminal`, such as `Jupyter Notebook` and `Git`.


### Git and GitHub
`Git` is a useful tool that helps you track changes in files, a process called version control. `GitHub` is a cloud-based implementation of `Git`, which allows you to store and manage your files in the cloud.

Both tools work well together to support the sharing of files and collaborating in workflows. With `Git`, you can work on your files locally and then upload changes to the cloud version of your files on `Github.com`. You can also share your files with others, who can review the files and suggest changes. 

In this course, you will learn how to use `Git`/`GitHub` workflows to implement version control for your files and to collaborate with others. 


### Python in Jupyter Notebook

`Python` is a widely used programming language in the sciences and provides strong functionality for working with a variety of data types and formats. `Jupyter Notebook` is a web-based tool that allows you to write and run `Python` interactively and to organize your code with outputs and documentations within `Jupyter Notebook` files. 

Writing and organizing your `Python` code with `Jupyter Notebook` supports open reproducible science by facilitating and supporting collaboration and documentation. 

In this course, you will learn how to use `Jupyter Notebook` to write and run `Python` code to organize, analyze, and visualize earth and environmental science data.
