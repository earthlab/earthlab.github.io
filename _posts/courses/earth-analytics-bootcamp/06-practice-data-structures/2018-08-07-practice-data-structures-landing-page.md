## <i class="fa fa-ship" aria-hidden="true"></i> Welcome to Day Six!

Welcome to Day Six of the Earth Analytics Bootcamp! Today, you will practice working with the data structures used in this course: lists, `numpy arrays` and `pandas dataframes`. You will also practice submitting pull requests to `Github` repositories. Rather than reviewing lessons, you will complete a hands-on activity. 


## <i class="fa fa-graduation-cap" aria-hidden="true"></i> Learning Objectives

By completing the activity for today, you will practice:

* Adding documentation to `Jupyter Notebook` using `Markdown` and `Python` comments
* Creating `Python` lists
* Downloading text files from `Figshare.com`
* Importing text files (.txt, .csv) into `numpy arrays` and `pandas dataframes`
* Selecting and summarizing data in `numpy arrays` and `pandas dataframes`

You will also learn how to:

* Use indexing to insert values into `Python` lists
* Manually create `numpy arrays` and `pandas dataframes`
