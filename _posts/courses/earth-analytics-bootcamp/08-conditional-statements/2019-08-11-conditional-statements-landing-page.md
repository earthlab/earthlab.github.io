Welcome to Day Eight of the Earth Analytics Bootcamp! Today, you will write `Python` code in `Jupyter Notebook` to implement another strategy for DRY (i.e. Do Not Repeat Yourself) code: conditional statements.

After completing the lessons for Day 8, you will be able to:

* Explain how conditional statements help you to write DRY code
* Write `Python` code for conditional statements to run tasks only when certain conditions are met
