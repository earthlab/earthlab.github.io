In this lesson, you will learn how to manage your `Jupyter Notebook` files and directories.

<div class='notice--success' markdown="1">

## <i class="fa fa-graduation-cap" aria-hidden="true"></i> Learning Objectives

After completing this lesson, you will be able to:

* Create new `Jupyter Notebook` files
* Rename and delete existing `Jupyter Notebook` files
* Create directories using the `Jupyter Notebook` Dashboard
* Move `Jupyter Notebook` files using the `Jupyter Notebook` Dashboard


## <i class="fa fa-check-square-o fa-2" aria-hidden="true"></i> What You Need

Be sure that you have completed the lesson on <a href="{{ site.url }}/courses/earth-analytics-bootcamp/get-started-with-open-science/jupyter-notebook-interface/">The Jupyter Notebook Interface.</a>

</div>

## Create New Jupyter Notebook Files

You already know how to open an existing `Jupyter Notebook file` (.ipynb) from the dashboard. 

You can also create new `Jupyter Notebook` files (.ipynb) from the dashboard.

On the top right of the dashboard, there are two buttons for `Upload` and `New`. `Upload` would allow you to import an existing `Jupyter Notebook` file (.ipynb) that is not already in that directory.

You can create a new Python 3 Jupyter Notebook file (.ipynb) by clicking on `New` and selecting `Python 3`. A new notebook will open a new tab in your web browser.

</figure>

## Rename Existing Jupyter Notebook Files

At the top of the new `Jupyter Notebook`, you will see that the file is named `Untitled`. 

You can change the name of the file by checking the box next to the filename and selecting `Rename`. A new window will open in which you can type the new name for the file.

You can use this same process to rename any existing Jupyter notebook.

## Delete Existing Jupyter Notebook Files

In addition to opening and creating `Jupyter Notebook` files (.ipynb) from the dashboard, you can also delete existing `Jupyter Notebook` files (.ipynb) from the dashboard. 

To delete an existing `Jupyter Notebook` file (.ipynb), click in the checkbox to left of the filename. You will see a red button with a trashcan appear in the top left of the dashboard menu. 

Click on that red trashcan button to delete any file that is checked in the list.

## Create Directories in Jupyter Notebook Dashboard

You can also create new directories from the dashboard to manage your `Jupyter Notebook` files (.ipynb).

In the `Jupyter Notebook` dashboard menu, select `New` and choose `Folder`.

<figure>

</figure>

At the top of the new `Jupyter Notebook`, you will see that the directory is named `Untitled`. 

You can change the name of the directory by clicking in the checkbox to left of the directory name and choosing `Rename`. 

<figure>
 <a href="{{ site.url }}/images/courses/earth-analytics/bootcamp/jupyter-interface/rename-folder.png">
 <img src="{{ site.url }}/images/courses/earth-analytics/bootcamp/jupyter-interface/rename-folder.png" alt="When you use the Jupyter Notebook dashboard menu to rename directories, a new window will open in which you can type the new name of the directory."></a>
 <figcaption> When you use the Jupyter Notebook dashboard menu to rename directories, a new window will open in which you can type the new name of the directory.
 </figcaption>
</figure>

You can use this same process to rename any folder. You can use the same process to delete directories by selecting the red trashcan, instead of `Rename`. 


## Move Jupyter Notebook Files

To move an existing `Jupyter Notebook` file (.ipynb), it needs to be shutdown first. 

To `Shutdown` a Jupyter Notebook file (.ipynb), click in the checkbox to left of the filename. You will see an orange button named `Shutdown` appear in the top left of the dashboard menu; click on it to `Shutdown` any file that is checked in the list.

After the notebook is shutdown, you can click in the checkbox to left of the filename and select `Move`. You will be asked to provide the path to directory to which to move the file.

## <i class="fa fa-pencil-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> Optional Challenge 

1. Create a new `Jupyter Notebook` file in your `earth-analytics-bootcamp` directory. 

2. Rename the new `Jupyter Notebook` file using your first initial and last name before `-markdown` (e.g. `jpalomino-markdown.ipynb`). 

3. Create a new folder called `markdown` in your `earth-analytics-bootcamp` directory. 

4. Move your new `Jupyter Notebook` file (e.g. `jpalomino-markdown.ipynb`) into the new `markdown` directory.
