## <i class="fa fa-ship" aria-hidden="true"></i> Welcome to Day Seven!

Welcome to Day Seven of the Earth Analytics Bootcamp! Today, you will learn about the DRY (i.e. Do Not Repeat Yourself) principle and write `Python` code in `Jupyter Notebook` to implement one strategy for writing DRY code in `Python`: loops.   


## <i class="fa fa-graduation-cap" aria-hidden="true"></i> Learning Objectives

After completing the lessons for Day 7, you will be able to:

* Define the DRY principle and list strategies for writing DRY code
* Explain how loops help you to write DRY code
* Write `Python` code for looping structures to run tasks multiple times without repeating the code
