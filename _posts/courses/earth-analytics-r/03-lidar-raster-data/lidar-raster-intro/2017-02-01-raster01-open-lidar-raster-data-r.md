In the last lesson, you reviewed the basic principles behind what a lidar raster
dataset is in `R` and how point clouds are used to derive the raster. In this lesson, you
will learn how to open and plot a lidar raster dataset in `R`. You will also learn
3 key attributes of a raster dataset:

1. Spatial resolution
2. Spatial extent
3. Coordinate reference system

## Open Raster Data in R

To work with raster data in `R`, you can use the `raster` and `rgdal` packages.


```r
# load libraries
library(raster)
library(rgdal)

# Make sure your working directory is set to  wherever your 'earth-analytics' dir is
# setwd("earth-analytics-dir-path-here")
```

You use the `raster("path-to-raster-here")` function to open a raster dataset in `R`.
Note that you use the `plot()` function to plot the data. The function argument
`main = ""` adds a title to the plot.


```r
# open raster data
lidar_dem <- raster(x = "data/week-03/BLDR_LeeHill/pre-flood/lidar/pre_DTM.tif")

# plot raster data
plot(lidar_dem,
     main = "Digital Elevation Model - Pre 2013 Flood")
```

If you zoom in on a small section of the raster, you can see the individual pixels
that make up the raster. Each pixel has one value associated with it. In this
case that value represents the elevation of ground.

Note that you are using the `xlim=` argument to zoom in to on region of the raster.
You can use `xlim` and `ylim` to define the x and y axis extents for any plot.


```r
# zoom in to one region of the raster
plot(lidar_dem,
  xlim = c(473000, 473030), # define the x limits
  ylim = c(4434000, 4434030), # define y limits for the plot
     main = "Lidar Raster - Zoomed into one small region")
```

Next, let's discuss some of the important spatial attributes associated with raster
data.

## 1. Coordinate Reference System

The coordinate reference system (`CRS`) of a spatial object tells `R` where
the raster is located in geographic space. It also tells `R` what method should
be used to “flatten” or project the raster in geographic space.

### What Makes Spatial Data Line Up on a Map?

You will learn `CRS` in more detail in next weeks class.
For this week, just remember that data from the same location
but saved in **different coordinate references systems will not line up in any GIS or other
program**. Thus, it's important when working with spatial data in a program like
`R` to identify the coordinate reference system applied to the data and retain
it throughout data processing and analysis.

### View Raster CRS in R

You can view the `CRS` string associated with your `R` object using the`crs()`
method. You can assign this string to an `R` object too.


```r
# view resolution units
crs(lidar_dem)
## CRS arguments:
##  +proj=utm +zone=13 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs +ellps=WGS84
## +towgs84=0,0,0

# assign crs to an object (class) to use for reprojection and other tasks
myCRS <- crs(lidar_dem)
myCRS
## CRS arguments:
##  +proj=utm +zone=13 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs +ellps=WGS84
## +towgs84=0,0,0
```

The `CRS` string for our `lidar_dem` object tells us that your data are in the UTM
projection.

<figure>
    <a href="{{ site.url }}/images/courses/earth-analytics/spatial-data/UTM-zones.png">
    <img src="{{ site.url }}/images/courses/earth-analytics/spatial-data/UTM-zones.png" alt="The UTM zones across the continental United States. Source:
   	Chrismurf, wikimedia.org."></a>
   	<figcaption> The UTM zones across the continental United States. Source:
   	Chrismurf, wikimedia.org.
		</figcaption>
</figure>

The `CRS` format, returned by `R`, is in a `PROJ 4` format. This means that the projection
information is strung together as a series of text elements, each of which
begins with a `+` sign.

 `+proj=utm +zone=18 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs +ellps=WGS84 +towgs84=0,0,0`

You'll focus on the first few components of the `CRS` in this tutorial.

* `+proj=utm` The projection of the dataset. Your data are in Universal
Transverse Mercator (`UTM`).
* `+zone=18` The `UTM` projection divides up the world into zones, this element
tells you which zone the data is in. Harvard Forest is in Zone 18.
* `+datum=WGS84` The datum was used to define the center point of the
projection. Your raster uses the `WGS84` datum.
* `+units=m` This is the **horizontal** units that the data are in. Your units
are meters.


<div class="notice--success" markdown="1">
<i fa fa-star></i>**Important:**
You are working with lidar data which has a Z or vertical value as well.
While the horizontal units often match the vertical units of a raster they don't
always! Be sure to check the metadata of your data to figure out the vertical
units!
</div>

## Spatial Extent

Next, let's discuss spatial extent. The spatial extent of a raster or spatial
object is the geographic area that the raster data covers.

    Notice that the spatial extent represents the rectangular area that the data cover.
    Thus, if the data are not rectangular (i.e. points OR an image that is rotated
    in some way) the spatial extent covers portions of the dataset where there are no data.

</figure>

The spatial extent of an `R` spatial object represents the geographic "edge" or
location that is the furthest north, south, east and west. In other words, `extent`
represents the overall geographic coverage of the spatial object.

## Raster Resolution

A raster has horizontal (x and y) resolution. This resolution represents the
area on the ground that each pixel covers. The units for your data are in meters.
In this case, your data resolution is 1 x 1. This means that each pixel represents
a 1 x 1 meter area on the ground. You can figure out the units of this resolution
using the `crs()` function which you will use next.


```r
# what is the x and y resolution for your raster data?
xres(lidar_dem)
## [1] 1
yres(lidar_dem)
## [1] 1
```

### Resolution Units

Resolution as a number doesn't mean anything unless you know the units. You can
figure out the horizontal (x and y) units from the coordinate reference system
string.


```r
# view coordinate reference system
crs(lidar_dem)
## CRS arguments:
##  +proj=utm +zone=13 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs +ellps=WGS84
## +towgs84=0,0,0
```

Notice this string contains an element called **units=m**. This means the units
are in meters. You won't get into too much detail about coordinate reference strings
in this weeks class but they are important to be familiar with when working with spatial
data. You will learn them in more detail during the semester!
