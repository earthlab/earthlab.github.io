## <i class="fa fa-graduation-cap" aria-hidden="true"></i> Learning Objectives

After completing this tutorial, you will be able to:

* Access metadata stored within a `geotiff` raster file via tif tags in `R`.
* Describe the difference between embedded metadata and non embedded metadata.
* Use `GDALinfo()` to quickly view key spatial metadata attributes associated with a spatial file.

You will need a computer with internet access to complete this lesson.

## What is a GeoTIFF??

A GeoTIFF is a standard `.tif` or image file format that includes additional spatial
(georeferencing) information embedded in the .tif file as tags. These are called embedded
tags, `tif tags`. These tags can include the following raster metadata:

1. **Spatial Extent:** What area does this dataset cover?
2. **Coordinate reference system:** What spatial projection / coordinate reference
system is used to store the data? Will it line up with other data?
3. **Resolution:** The data appears to be in **raster** format. This means it is
composed of pixels. What area on the ground does each pixel cover - i.e. What is
its spatial resolution?
4. **No data value**
5. **Layers:** How many layers are in the .tif file. (more on that later)

You learned spatial extent and resolution in the previous lesson. When you work with
`geotiff`s the spatial information that describes the raster data are embedded within
the file itself.

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data note:**  Your camera uses embedded tags to store
information about pictures that you take including the camera make and model,
and the time the image was taken.

### Geotiffs in R

The `raster` package in `R` allows us to both open `geotiff` files and also directly
access `.tif tags` programmatically. You can quickly view the spatial **extent**,
**coordinate reference system** and **resolution** of your raster data.

NOTE: not all `geotiff`s contain `tif` tags!

You can use `GDALinfo()` to view all of the relevant tif tags embedded within a
`geotiff` before you open it in `R`.


```r
# view attributes associated with your DTM geotiff
GDALinfo("data/week-03/BLDR_LeeHill/pre-flood/lidar/pre_DTM.tif")
## rows        2000 
## columns     4000 
## bands       1 
## lower left origin.x        472000 
## lower left origin.y        4434000 
## res.x       1 
## res.y       1 
## ysign       -1 
## oblique.x   0 
## oblique.y   0 
## driver      GTiff 
## projection  +proj=utm +zone=13 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs 
## file        data/week-03/BLDR_LeeHill/pre-flood/lidar/pre_DTM.tif 
## apparent band summary:
##    GDType hasNoDataValue                              NoDataValue
## 1 Float32           TRUE -340282346638528859811704183484516925440
##   blockSize1 blockSize2
## 1        128        128
## apparent band statistics:
##          Bmin       Bmax Bmean Bsd
## 1 -4294967295 4294967295    NA  NA
## Metadata:
## AREA_OR_POINT=Area
```

The information returned from `GDALinfo()` includes:

* x and y resolution
* projection
* data format (in this case your data are stored in float format which means they contain decimals)

and more.

You can also extract or view individual metadata attributes.


```r
# view attributes / metadata of raster
# open raster data
lidar_dem <- raster(x = "data/week-03/BLDR_LeeHill/pre-flood/lidar/pre_DTM.tif")
# view crs
crs(lidar_dem)
## CRS arguments:
##  +proj=utm +zone=13 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs +ellps=WGS84
## +towgs84=0,0,0

# view extent via the slot - note that slot names can change so this may not always work.
lidar_dem@extent
## class      : Extent 
## xmin       : 472000 
## xmax       : 476000 
## ymin       : 4434000 
## ymax       : 4436000
```

If you extract metadata from your data, you can then perform tests on the data as
you process it. For instance, you can ask the question:

> Do both datasets have the same spatial extent?

Let's find out the answer to this question using `R`.


```r
lidar_dsm <- raster(x = "data/week-03/BLDR_LeeHill/pre-flood/lidar/pre_DSM.tif")

extent_lidar_dsm <- extent(lidar_dsm)
extent_lidar_dem <- extent(lidar_dem)

# Do the two datasets cover the same spatial extents?
if (extent_lidar_dem == extent_lidar_dsm) {
  print("Both datasets cover the same spatial extent")
}
## [1] "Both datasets cover the same spatial extent"
```

Does the data have the same spatial extents?


```r
compareRaster(lidar_dsm, lidar_dem,
              extent = TRUE)
## [1] TRUE
```

or resolution?


```r
compareRaster(lidar_dsm, lidar_dem,
              res = TRUE)
## [1] TRUE
```


## Single Layer (or Band) vs Multi-Layer (Band Geotiffs)

You will learn this further when you work with RGB (color) imagery in later weeks
of this course, however `geotiff`s can also store more than one band or layer. You
can see if a raster object has more than one layer using the `nlayers()` function
in `R`.


```r
nlayers(lidar_dsm)
## [1] 1
```

Now that you better understand the `geotiff` file format, you will work with some
other lidar raster data layers.
