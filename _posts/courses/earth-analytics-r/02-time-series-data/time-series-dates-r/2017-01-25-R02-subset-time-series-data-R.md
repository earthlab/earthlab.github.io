## Important - Data Organization
Before you begin this lesson, be sure that you've downloaded the dataset above.
You will need to UNZIP the zip file. When you do this, be sure that your directory
looks like the image below: note that all of the data are within the week2
directory. They are not nested within another directory. You may have to copy and
paste your files to make this look right.

<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/courses/earth-analytics/co-flood-lessons/week-02-data.png" alt="week 2 file organization">
</a>
<figcaption>Your `week_02` file directory should look like the one above. Note that
the data directory is directly under the earth-analytics folder.</figcaption>
</figure>

## Get Started with Time Series Data
To begin, load the `ggplot2` and `dplyr` libraries. Also, set your
working directory. Finally, set `stringsAsFactors` to `FALSE` globally using
`options(stringsAsFactors = FALSE)`.


```r
# set your working directory to the earth-analytics directory
# setwd("working-dir-path-here")

# load packages
library(ggplot2)
library(lubridate)
library(dplyr)

# set strings as factors to false
options(stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

## Import Precipitation Time Series

You will use a precipitation dataset collected by the
National Centers for Environmental Information (formerly
National Climate Data Center) Cooperative Observer Network (COOP)
station 050843 in Boulder, CO. The data cover the time span between 1 January
2003 through 31 December 2013.

To begin, use `read.csv()` to import the `.csv` file.


```r
# download the data
# download.file(url = "https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/7283285",
#              destfile = "data/week-02/805325-precip-dailysum_2003-2013.csv")

# import the data
boulder_daily_precip <- read.csv("data/week-02/precipitation/805325-precip-dailysum-2003-2013.csv",
         header = TRUE)

### About the Data

Viewing the structure of these data, you can see that different types of data are included in
this file:

* **STATION** and **STATION_NAME**: Identification of the COOP station.
* **ELEVATION, LATITUDE** and **LONGITUDE**: The spatial location of the station.
* **DATE**: The date when the data were collected in the format: YYYYMMDD. Notice that DATE is
currently class `chr`, meaning the data is interpreted as a character class and
not as a date.
* **DAILY_PRECIP**: The total precipitation in inches. Important: the metadata
notes that the value 999.99 indicates missing data. Also important,
hours with no precipitation are not recorded.
* **YEAR**: The year the data were collected.
* **JULIAN**: The JULIAN DAY the data were collected.


Additional information about the data, known as metadata, is available in the
<a href="https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/7283453">PRECIP_HLY_documentation.pdf</a>.
The metadata tell us that the noData value for these data is 999.99. IMPORTANT:
You have modified these data a bit for ease of teaching and learning. Specifically,
you've aggregated the data to represent daily sum values and added some noData
values to ensure you learn how to clean them!

You can download the original complete data subset with additional documentation
<a href="https://figshare.com/articles/NEON_Remote_Sensing_Boulder_Flood_2013_Teaching_Data_Subset_Lee_Hill_Road/3146284">here. </a>

Using everything you've learned in the previous lessons:

* Import the dataset: `data/week-02/precipitation/805325-precip-dailysum-2003-2013.csv`.
* Clean the data by assigning noData values to `NA`.
* Make sure the date column is a date class.
* When you are done, plot it using `ggplot()`.
  * Be sure to include a TITLE, and label the X and Y axes.
  * Change the color of the plotted points.

Some notes to help you along:

* Date: Be sure to take off the date format when you import the data.
* NoData Values: You know that the no data value = 999.99. You can account for this
when you read in the data. Remember how?

Your final plot should look something like the plot below.
</div>

### Import Data and Reassign na Values

To begin, import the data. Be sure to use the `na.strings` argument to remove `NA` values.
Also your data have a header (the first row represents column names) so set `header = TRUE`


```r
# import data
boulder_daily_precip <- read.csv("data/week-02/precipitation/805325-precip-dailysum-2003-2013.csv",
         header = TRUE,
         na.strings = 999.99)
```


Next, take care of the date field. In this case you have month/day/year. You can
use `?strptime` to figure out which letters you need to use in the format = argument
to ensure your data elements (month, day and year) are understood by `R`.

In this case you want to use

* %m - for month
* %d - for day
* %y - for year

Also take note of the format of your date. In this case, each date element is
separated by a `/`.


```r
# format date field
boulder_daily_precip$DATE <- as.Date(boulder_daily_precip$DATE,
                                     format = "%m/%d/%y")
```

Finally, you can plot the data using `ggplot()`. Notice that when you plot, you first
populate the `data` and `aes` (aesthetics).

* **data =** contain the data frame that you want to plot
* **aes =** contain the x and y variables that you want to plot

Finally `geom_point()` represents the geometry that you want to plot. In this case
you are creating a scatter plot (using points).


```r

# plot the data using ggplot2
ggplot(data=boulder_daily_precip, aes(x = DATE, y = DAILY_PRECIP)) +
      geom_point() +
      labs(title = "Precipitation - Boulder, Colorado")
```

<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/courses/earth-analytics-r/02-time-series-data/time-series-dates-r/2017-01-25-R02-subset-time-series-data-R/plot-precip-hourly-1.png" title="precip plot w fixed dates" alt="precip plot w fixed dates" width="90%" />


### NA Values and Warnings

When you plot the data, you get a warning that says:

`## Warning: Removed 4 rows containing missing values (geom_point).`

You can get rid of this warning by removing NA or missing data values from your
data. A warning is just `R`'s way of letting you know that something may be wrong.
In this case, it can't plot 4 data points because there are missing data values
there.

Let's remove the missing data value rows using a `dplyr` pipe and the `na.omit()` function.
You will learn about pipes in just a minute!


```r
boulder_daily_precip <- boulder_daily_precip %>%
  na.omit()
```

Now you can plot the data without a warning!


```r

# plot the data using ggplot2
ggplot(data=boulder_daily_precip, aes(x = DATE, y = DAILY_PRECIP)) +
      geom_point(color = "darkorchid4") +
      labs(title = "Precipitation - Boulder, Colorado")
```

<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/courses/earth-analytics-r/02-time-series-data/time-series-dates-r/2017-01-25-R02-subset-time-series-data-R/plot-precip-hourly2-1.png" title="precip plot w fixed dates and no na values" alt="precip plot w fixed dates and no na values" width="90%" />

Don't forget to add x and y axis labels to your plot!
Use the `labs()` function to add a title, x and y label (and subtitle if you'd like) to your plot.


```r
labs(title = "Hourly Precipitation - Boulder Station\n 2003-2013",
     x = "Date",
     y = "Precipitation (Inches)")
```


```r
ggplot(data = boulder_daily_precip, aes(DATE, DAILY_PRECIP)) +
      geom_point(color = "darkorchid4") +
      labs(title = "Hourly Precipitation - Boulder Station\n 2003-2013",
           x = "Date",
           y = "Precipitation (Inches)")
```

You can add a ggplot theme to adjust the look of your plot quickly too. Below
you use `theme_bw()`. Below you also adjust the base font size to make the labels
a bit larger `base_size = 11`.

      geom_point(color = "darkorchid4") +
      labs(title = "Hourly Precipitation - Boulder Station\n 2003-2013",
           x = "Date",
           y = "Precipitation (Inches)") + theme_bw(base_size = 11)

Take a close look at the plot:

* What does each point represent?
* Use the `min()` and `max()` functions to determine the minimum and maximum precipitation values for the 10 year span?

### Introduction to the Pipe %>%

Above you used pipes to manipulate your data. Specifically you removed `NA` values
in a pipe with `na.omit()`.

Pipes let you take the output of one function and send it directly to the next,
which is useful when you need to do many things to the same data set. Pipes in `R`
look like `%>%` and are made available via the `magrittr` package, installed
automatically with `dplyr`.



```r
boulder_daily_precip <- boulder_daily_precip %>%
  na.omit()
```


Pipes are nice to use when coding because:

1. they remove intermediately created variables (keeping your environment cleaner / fewer variables are saved memory)
1. they combine multiple steps of processing into a clean set of steps that is easy to read once you become familiar with the pipes syntax

You can do all of the same things that you did above with one pipe. Let's see
how:


```r
# format date field without pipes
boulder_daily_precip$DATE <- as.Date(boulder_daily_precip$DATE,
                                     format = "%m/%d/%y")
```

With pipes you can use the mutate function to either create a new column or
modify the format or contents of an existing column.


```r
boulder_daily_precip <- boulder_daily_precip %>%
  mutate(DATE = as.Date(DATE, format = "%m/%d/%y"))
```

You can then add the `na.omit()` function to the above code


```r
boulder_daily_precip <- boulder_daily_precip %>%
  mutate(DATE = as.Date(DATE, format = "%m/%d/%y")) %>%
  na.omit()
```

Notice that each time you assign the pipe to a variable, you are overwriting
that variable.

`boulder_daily_precip <- boulder_daily_precip`

In this case you are just updating your current `boulder_daily_precip` variable.

The process above avoids processing the data in separate steps, and potentially
creating new variables each time. You can even send the output to ggplot().
When you send output to ggplot() in a pipe, you don't need the use the
data argument (`data = boulder_daily_precip`) because you send the data throught
the pipe. Like this:

Note: that because you are creating a plot with the code below, you don't need
to assign the pipe to a variable. Thus you leave out the

`boulder_daily_precip <-`

assignment.


```r

boulder_daily_precip %>%
  mutate(DATE = as.Date(boulder_daily_precip$DATE, format = "%m/%d/%y")) %>%
  na.omit() %>%
ggplot(aes(DATE, DAILY_PRECIP)) +
      geom_point(color = "darkorchid4") +
      labs(title = "Hourly Precipitation - Boulder Station\n 2003-2013",
           subtitle = "plotted using pipes",
           x = "Date",
           y = "Precipitation (Inches)") + theme_bw()
```

<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/courses/earth-analytics-r/02-time-series-data/time-series-dates-r/2017-01-25-R02-subset-time-series-data-R/plot-with-pipe-1.png" title="data plotted with a pipe" alt="data plotted with a pipe" width="90%" />


## Subset the Data

You may want to only work with a subset of your time series data. Let's create a subset of data for the time period around the flood between 15
August to 15 October 2013. You use the `filter()` function in the `dplyr` package
to do this and pipes!



```r
# subset 2 months around flood
precip_boulder_AugOct <- boulder_daily_precip %>%
                        filter(DATE >= as.Date('2013-08-15') & DATE <= as.Date('2013-10-15'))
```

In the code above, you use the pipe to send the `boulder_daily_precip` data through
a filter step. In that filter step, you filter out only the rows within the
date range that you specified. Since `%>%` takes the object on its left and passes
it as the first argument to the function on its right, you don't need to explicitly include it as an argument to the `filter()` function.



```r
# check the first & last dates
min(precip_boulder_AugOct$DATE)
## [1] "2013-08-21"
max(precip_boulder_AugOct$DATE)
## [1] "2013-10-11"

# create new plot
ggplot(data = precip_boulder_AugOct, aes(DATE,DAILY_PRECIP)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "darkorchid4") +
  xlab("Date") + ylab("Precipitation (inches)") +
  ggtitle("Daily Total Precipitation Aug - Oct 2013 for Boulder Creek") +
  theme_bw()
```

## <i class="fa fa-pencil-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> Optional Challenge

Create a subset from the same dates in 2012 to compare to the 2013 plot.
Use the `ylim()` argument to ensure the y axis range is the SAME as the previous
plot - from 0 to 10".

How different was the rainfall in 2012?

HINT: type `?lims` in the console to see how the `xlim` and `ylim` arguments work.
