## Get Started with Date Formats in R

In this tutorial, you will look at the date time format - which is important for
plotting and working with time series data in `R`.

<div class='notice--success' markdown="1">

## <i class="fa fa-graduation-cap" aria-hidden="true"></i> Learning Objectives

At the end of this activity, you will be able to:

* Convert a column in a `data.frame` containing dates and times to a date/time object that can be used in `R`.
* Be able to describe how you can use the data class 'date' to create easier to read time series plots in `R`.

## <i class="fa fa-check-square-o fa-2" aria-hidden="true"></i> What You Need

You need `R` and `RStudio` to complete this tutorial. Also we recommend that you
have an `earth-analytics` directory set up on your computer with a `/data`
directory within it.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to convert data that contain dates and times
into a date / time format in `R`.

First let's revisit the `boulder_precip` data variable that you've been working with in
this module.


```r
# load the ggplot2 library for plotting
library(ggplot2)
options(stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
# download data from figshare
# note that you already downloaded the data in the previous exercises so this line
# is commented out. If you want to redownload the data, umcomment the line below.
download.file("https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/9282364",
              "data/boulder-precip.csv",
              method = "libcurl")

# import data
boulder_precip <- read.csv(file = "data/boulder-precip.csv")

# view first few rows of the data
head(boulder_precip)
##    ID    DATE PRECIP TEMP
## 1 756 8/21/13    0.1   55
## 2 757 8/26/13    0.1   25
## 3 758 8/27/13    0.1   NA
## 4 759  9/1/13    0.0 -999
## 5 760  9/9/13    0.1   15
## 6 761 9/10/13    1.0   25
```

Next, plot the data using `ggplot()`.


```r
# plot the data using ggplot
ggplot(data = boulder_precip, aes(x = DATE, y = PRECIP)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Date",
    y = "Total Precipitation (Inches)",
    title = "Precipitation Data",
    subtitle = "Boulder, Colorado 2013")
```

Notice when you plot the data, the x axis is "messy". It would be easier to read
if you only had ticks on the x axis for dates incrementally - every few weeks. Or
once a month even.

Let's look closely at the structure of the data to understand why `R` is placing
so many labels on the x axis.



```r
str(boulder_precip)
## 'data.frame':	18 obs. of  4 variables:
##  $ ID    : int  756 757 758 759 760 761 762 763 764 765 ...
##  $ DATE  : chr  "8/21/13" "8/26/13" "8/27/13" "9/1/13" ...
##  $ PRECIP: num  0.1 0.1 0.1 0 0.1 1 2.3 9.8 1.9 1.4 ...
##  $ TEMP  : int  55 25 NA -999 15 25 65 NA 95 -999 ...
```


## Data Types (Classes) in R

The structure results above tell us that the data columns in your `data.frame`
are stored as several different data types or `classes` as follows:

* **chr - Character:** It holds strings that are composed of letters and
words. Character class data cannot be interpreted numerically - that is to say
you can not perform math on these values even if they contain only numbers.
* **int - Integer:**  It holds numbers that are whole integers without decimals.
Mathematical operations can be performed on integers.
* **num - Numeric:**  It accepts data that are a wide variety of numeric formats
including decimals (floating point values) and integers. Numeric also accept
larger numbers than **int** will.

### Data Frame Columns Can Only Contain One Data Class

A `data.frame` column can only store one type. This means that a column cannot
store both numbers and strings. If a column contains a list of numbers and one
letter, then the entire column will be stored as a `chr` (character).

Storing variables using different `classes` is a strategic decision by `R` (and
other programming languages) that optimizes processing and storage. It allows:

* data to be processed more quickly & efficiently.
* the program (`R`) to minimize the storage size.

Remember, that you also learned about classes during class in these lessons: [vectors in R - data classes](/courses/earth-analytics/time-series-data/work-with-data-types-r/)

## Dates Stored as Characters
Note that the Date column in your `data.frame` is of class character (`chr`). This
means that `R`  is reading it as letters and numbers rather than dates that
contain a value that is sequential.


```r
# View data class for each column that you wish to plot
class(boulder_precip$DATE)
## [1] "character"

class(boulder_precip$PRECIP)
## [1] "numeric"
```

Thus, when you plot, `R` tries to plot EVERY date value in your data, on
the x-axis. This makes it hard to read. But also it makes it hard to work with
the data. For instance - what if you wanted to subset out a particular time period
from your data? You can't do that if the data are stored as characters.

The `PRECIP` data is numeric so that variable plots just fine.

## Convert Date to an R Date Class

You need to convert your `date` column, which is currently stored as a character
to a `date` class that can be displayed as a continuous variable. Lucky
for us, `R` has a `date` class. You can convert the `date` field to a `date class`
using the function `as.Date()`.

When you convert, you need to tell `R` how the date is formatted - where it can find
the month, day and year and what format each element is in.

For example: 1/1/10 vs 1-1-2010

Looking at the results above, you see that your data are stored in the format:
Year-Month-Day (2003-08-21). Each part of the date is separated in this case with
a `-`. You can use this information to populate your format
string using the following designations for the components of the date-time data:

* `%Y` - 4 digit year
* `%y` - 2 digit year
* `%m` - month
* `%d` - day

Your format string will look like this: `%m/%d/%y`. Notice that you are telling
`R` where to find the year (`%y`), month (`%m`) and day (`%d`). Also notice that you
include the dashes that separate each component in each date cell of your data.

NOTE: look up `?strptime` to see all of the date "elements" that you can use to
describe the format of a date string in `R`.
{: .notice--success}



```r
# convert date column to date class
boulder_precip$DATE <- as.Date(boulder_precip$DATE,
                        format = "%m/%d/%y")

# view R class of data
class(boulder_precip$DATE)
## [1] "Date"

# view results
head(boulder_precip$DATE)
## [1] "2013-08-21" "2013-08-26" "2013-08-27" "2013-09-01" "2013-09-09"
## [6] "2013-09-10"
```

Now that you have adjusted the date, let's plot again. Notice that it plots
much quicker now that `R` recognizes `date` as a date class. `R` can
aggregate ticks on the x-axis by year instead of trying to plot every day!


```r
# quickly plot the data and include a title using main = ""
# use '\n' to force the string to wrap onto a new line

ggplot(data = boulder_precip, aes(x = DATE, y = PRECIP)) +
      geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "purple") +
      labs(title = "Total daily precipitation in Boulder, Colorado",
           subtitle = "Fall 2013",
           x = "Date", y = "Daily Precipitation (Inches)")
```

Now, your plot looks a lot nicer!
