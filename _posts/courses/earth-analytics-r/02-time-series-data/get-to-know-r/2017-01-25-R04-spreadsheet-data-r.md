{% include toc title="In This Lesson" icon="file-text" %}



This lesson introduces the data.frame which is very similar to working with
a spreadsheet in `R`.

<div class='notice--success' markdown="1">

## <i class="fa fa-graduation-cap" aria-hidden="true"></i> Learning Objectives
At the end of this activity, you will be able to:

* Open `.csv` or text file containing tabular (spreadsheet) formatted data in `R`.
* Quickly plot the data using the `GGPLOT2` function `qplot()`.

## <i class="fa fa-check-square-o fa-2" aria-hidden="true"></i> What You Need

You need `R` and `RStudio` to complete this tutorial. Also we recommend that you
have an `earth-analytics` directory set up on your computer with a `/data`
directory within it.

* [Set up your working directory](/courses/earth-analytics/document-your-science/setup-working-directory/)


</div>

In the homework from week 1, you used the code below to create a report with `knitr`
in `RStudio`.


```r

# load the ggplot2 library for plotting
library(ggplot2)

# turn off factors
options(stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# download data from figshare
download.file("https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/9282364",
              "data/boulder-precip.csv",
              method = "libcurl")
```

Let's break the code above down. First, you use the `download.file` function to
download a datafile. In this case, the data are housed on
<a href="http://www.figshare.com" target="_blank">Figshare</a> - a
popular data repository that is free to use if your data are cumulatively
smaller than 20gb.

Notice that `download.file()` function has two **ARGUMENTS**:

1. **url**: this is the path to the data file that you wish to download.
2. **destfile**: this is the location on your computer (in this case: `/data`) and name of the
file when saved (in this case: boulder-precip.csv). So you downloaded a file from
a url on figshare to your data directory. You named that file `boulder-precip.csv`.

Next, you read in the data using the function: `read.csv()`.




```r

# import data
boulder_precip <- read.csv(file = "data/boulder-precip.csv")

# view first few rows of the data
head(boulder_precip)
##     X       DATE PRECIP
## 1 756 2013-08-21    0.1
## 2 757 2013-08-26    0.1
## 3 758 2013-08-27    0.1
## 4 759 2013-09-01    0.0
## 5 760 2013-09-09    0.1
## 6 761 2013-09-10    1.0

# view the format of the boulder_precip object in R
str(boulder_precip)
## 'data.frame':	18 obs. of  3 variables:
##  $ X     : int  756 757 758 759 760 761 762 763 764 765 ...
##  $ DATE  : chr  "2013-08-21" "2013-08-26" "2013-08-27" "2013-09-01" ...
##  $ PRECIP: num  0.1 0.1 0.1 0 0.1 1 2.3 9.8 1.9 1.4 ...
```
<div class="notice--warning" markdown="1">

## <i class="fa fa-pencil-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> Challenge
What is the format associated with each column for the `boulder_precip`
data.frame? Describe the attributes of each format. Can you perform math
on each column? Why or why not?

<!--
integer - numbers without decimal points,
character: text strings
number: numeric values (can contain decimals places)

## Introduction to the Data Frame

When you read data into `R` using `read.csv()` it imports it into a data frame format.
Data frames are the **de facto** data structure for most tabular data, and what you
use for statistics and plotting.

A `data.frame` is a collection of vectors of identical lengths. Each vector
represents a column, and each vector can be of a different data type (e.g.
characters, integers, factors). The `str()` function is useful to inspect the
data types of the columns.

A `data.frame` can be created by hand but most commonly they are generated when
you import a text file or spreadsheet into `R` using the
functions `read.csv()` or `read.table()`.

## Extracting / Specifying "Columns" by Name

You can extract just one single column from your data.frame using the `$` symbol
followed by the name of the column (or the column header):


```r
# when you download the data you create a data.frame
# view each column of the data frame using its name (or header)
boulder_precip$DATE
##  [1] "2013-08-21" "2013-08-26" "2013-08-27" "2013-09-01" "2013-09-09"
##  [6] "2013-09-10" "2013-09-11" "2013-09-12" "2013-09-13" "2013-09-15"
## [11] "2013-09-16" "2013-09-22" "2013-09-23" "2013-09-27" "2013-09-28"
## [16] "2013-10-01" "2013-10-04" "2013-10-11"

# view the precip column
boulder_precip$PRECIP
##  [1] 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.0 0.1 1.0 2.3 9.8 1.9 1.4 0.4 0.1 0.3 0.3 0.1 0.0 0.9
## [18] 0.1
```


## View Structure of a Data Frame

You can explore the format of your data frame in a similar way to how you explored
vectors in the third lesson of this module. Let's take a look.



```r
# when you download the data you create a data.frame
# view each column of the data frame using its name (or header)
# how many rows does the data frame have
nrow(boulder_precip)
## [1] 18

# view the precip column
boulder_precip$PRECIP
##  [1] 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.0 0.1 1.0 2.3 9.8 1.9 1.4 0.4 0.1 0.3 0.3 0.1 0.0 0.9
## [18] 0.1
```

## Plotting Your Data

YOu can quickly plot your data too. Note that you are using the `ggplot2` function
`qplot()` rather than the `R` base plot functionality. You are doing this because
`ggplot2` is generally more powerful and efficient to use for plotting.


```r
# q plot stands for quick plot. Let's use it to plot your data
qplot(x = boulder_precip$DATE,
      y = boulder_precip$PRECIP)
```
