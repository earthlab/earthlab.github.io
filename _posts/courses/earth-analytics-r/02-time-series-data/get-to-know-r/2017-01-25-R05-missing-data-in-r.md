This lesson covers how to work with no data values in `R`.

<div class='notice--success' markdown="1">

## <i class="fa fa-graduation-cap" aria-hidden="true"></i> Learning Objectives
At the end of this activity, you will be able to:

* Understand why it is important to make note of missing data values.
* Be able to define what a `NA` value is in `R` and how it is used in a vector.

## <i class="fa fa-check-square-o fa-2" aria-hidden="true"></i> What You Need

You need `R` and `RStudio` to complete this tutorial. Also we recommend that you
have an `earth-analytics` directory set up on your computer with a `/data`
directory within it.

## Missing Data - No Data Values

Sometimes, your data are missing values. Imagine a spreadsheet in Microsoft Excel
with cells that are blank. If the cells are blank, you don't know for sure whether
those data weren't collected, or someone forgot to fill them in. To account
for data that are missing (not by mistake) you can put a value in those cells
that represents `no data`.

The `R` programming language uses the value `NA` to represent missing data values.


```r

planets <- c("Mercury", "Venus", "Earth", "Mars", "Jupiter", "Saturn", "Uranus",
             "Neptune", NA)
```

The default setting for most base functions that read data into `R` is to
interpret `NA` as a missing value.

Let's have a closer look at this using the `boulder_precip` data that you've
used in the previous lessons. Please download the data again as there have
been some changes made!


```r
# download file
download.file("https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/9282364",
              "data/boulder-precip-temp.csv",
              method = "libcurl")
```

Then you can open the data.


```r
# import data but don't specify no data values - what happens?
boulder_precip <- read.csv(file = "data/boulder-precip-temp.csv")

str(boulder_precip)
## 'data.frame':	18 obs. of  4 variables:
##  $ ID    : int  756 757 758 759 760 761 762 763 764 765 ...
##  $ DATE  : chr  "8/21/13" "8/26/13" "8/27/13" "9/1/13" ...
##  $ PRECIP: num  0.1 0.1 0.1 0 0.1 1 2.3 9.8 1.9 1.4 ...
##  $ TEMP  : int  55 25 NA -999 15 25 65 NA 95 -999 ...
```

In the example below, note how a mean value is calculated differently depending
upon on how `NA` values are treated when the data are imported.



```r
# view mean values
mean(boulder_precip$PRECIP)
## [1] 1.055556
mean(boulder_precip$TEMP)
## [1] NA
```

Notice that you are able to calculate a mean value for `PRECIP` but `TEMP` returns a
`NA` value. Why? Let's plot your data to figure out what might be going on.


```r
library(ggplot2)
# are there values in the TEMP column of your data?
boulder_precip$TEMP
##  [1]   55   25   NA -999   15   25   65   NA   95 -999   85 -999   85   85
## [15] -999   57   60   65
# plot the data with ggplot
ggplot(data = boulder_precip, aes(x = DATE, y = TEMP)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Temperature data for Boulder, CO")
## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (geom_point).
```

Looking at your data, it appears as if you have some extremely large negative values
hovering around -1000. However why did your mean return NA?

When performing mathematical operations on numbers in `R`, most functions will
return the value `NA` if the data you are working with include missing or nodata values.

Returning NA values allows you to see that you have missing data in your dataset.
You can then decide how you want to handle the missing data. Youcan add the
argument `na.rm=TRUE` to calculate the result while ignoring the missing values.


```r
heights <- c(2, 4, 4, NA, 6)
mean(heights)
## [1] NA
max(heights)
## [1] NA
mean(heights, na.rm = TRUE)
## [1] 4
max(heights, na.rm = TRUE)
## [1] 6
```

Let's try to add the na.rm argument to your code mean calculation on the
temperature column above.


```r
# calculate mean usign the na.rm argument
mean(boulder_precip$PRECIP)
## [1] 1.055556
mean(boulder_precip$TEMP, na.rm = TRUE)
## [1] -204.9375
```


<i fa fa-star></i>**Data Tip:** The functions, `is.na()`, `na.omit()`, and `complete.cases()` are all useful for
figuring out if your data has assigned (`NA`) no-data values. See below for
examples.
{: .notice--success}

So now you have successfully calculated the mean value of both precipitation and
temperature in your spreadsheet. However does the mean temperature value (-204.9375 make
sense looking at the data? It seems a bit low - you know that there aren't temperature
values of -200 here in Boulder, Colorado!

Remembering the plot above you noticed that you had some values that were
close to -1000. Looking at the summary below you see the exact minimum value
is -999.


```r
# calculate mean usign the na.rm argument
summary(boulder_precip$TEMP, na.rm = TRUE)
##    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.    NA's 
##  -999.0  -238.5    56.0  -204.9    70.0    95.0       2
```


## Finding & Assigning No Data Values

Sometimes, you'll find a dataset that uses another value for missing data. In some
disciplines, for example -999, is frequently used. If there are multiple types of
missing values in your dataset, you can extend what `R` considers a missing value when it reads
the file in using the "`na.strings`" argument.

Below use the `na.strings` argument on your data. Notice that you can tell `R`
that there are several potential ways that your data documents nodata values.

You can provide `R` with a vector of missing date values as follows:

`c("NA", " ", "-999")`

Thus `R` will assign any calls with the values of nothing `""`, `NA` or `-999` to `NA`.
This should solve all of your missing data problems!


```r
# import data but specify no data values - what happens?
boulder_precip_na <- read.csv(file = "data/boulder-precip-temp.csv",
                     na.strings = c("NA", " ", "-999"))
boulder_precip_na$TEMP
##  [1] 55 25 NA NA 15 25 65 NA 95 NA 85 NA 85 85 NA 57 60 65
```

Does your new plot look better?


```r
# are there values in the TEMP column of your data?
boulder_precip$TEMP
##  [1]   55   25   NA -999   15   25   65   NA   95 -999   85 -999   85   85
## [15] -999   57   60   65
# plot the data with ggplot
ggplot(data = boulder_precip_na, aes(x = DATE, y = TEMP)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Temperature data for Boulder, CO",
       subtitle = "missing data accounted for")
## Warning: Removed 6 rows containing missing values (geom_point).
```

## <i class="fa fa-pencil-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> Optional Challenge

* **Question**: Why, in the the example above did mean(boulder_precip$avg_temp) return
a value of NA?

<!-- * _Answer_: Because if there are NA values in a dataset, R can not automatically
perform the calculation. you need to add a na.rm=TRUE to remove NA values. -->

* **Question**: Why, in the the example above did mean(boulder_precip$avg_temp, na.rm = TRUE)
also return a value of NA?

<!-- * _Answer_: Because you didn't remove NA values when you imported the first data.frame. thus
if there are NA values in a dataset, R can not automatically
perform the calculation even with using na.rm=TRUE because there are no NA values
in the data.frame . -->

```r
# Extract those elements which are not missing values.
heights[!is.na(heights)]
## [1] 2 4 4 6

# Returns the object with incomplete cases removed. The returned object is atomic.
na.omit(heights)
## [1] 2 4 4 6
## attr(,"na.action")
## [1] 4
## attr(,"class")
## [1] "omit"

# Extract those elements which are complete cases.
heights[complete.cases(heights)]
## [1] 2 4 4 6

## <i class="fa fa-pencil-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> Challenge Activity

* **Question**: Why does the following piece of code return a warning?


```r
sample <- c(2, 4, 4, "NA", 6)
mean(sample, na.rm = TRUE)
## Warning in mean.default(sample, na.rm = TRUE): argument is not numeric or
## logical: returning NA
## [1] NA
```
<!-- * _Answer_: Because R recognizes the NA in quotes as a character. -->

* **Question**: Why does the warning message say the argument is not numeric?
<!-- * _Answer_: R converts the entire vector to character because of the "NA", and doesn't recognize it as numeric. -->
