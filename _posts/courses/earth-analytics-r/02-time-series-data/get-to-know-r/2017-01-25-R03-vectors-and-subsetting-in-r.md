## <i class="fa fa-graduation-cap" aria-hidden="true"></i> Learning Objectives
At the end of this activity, you will be able to:

* Understand the structure of and be able to create a vector object in `R`.

## <i class="fa fa-check-square-o fa-2" aria-hidden="true"></i> What You Need

You need `R` and `RStudio` to complete this tutorial. Also we recommend that you
have an `earth-analytics` directory set up on your computer with a `/data`
directory within it.

## Vectors and Data Types

A vector is the most common data structure in `R`. A vector is defined as a
group of values, which most often are either numbers or characters. You can
assign this list of values to an object or variable, just like you
can for a single value. For example you can create a vector of animal weights:


```r
weight_g <- c(50, 60, 65, 82)
weight_g
## [1] 50 60 65 82
```

A vector can also contain characters:


```r
animals <- c("mouse", "rat", "dog")
animals
## [1] "mouse" "rat"   "dog"
```

There are many functions that allow you to inspect the content of a
vector. `length()` tells you how many elements are in a particular vector:


```r
length(weight_g)
## [1] 4
length(animals)
## [1] 3
```

## Vector Data Types

An important feature of a vector is that all of the elements are the same data
type. The function `class()` shows us the class (the data type) of an object:


```r
class(weight_g)
## [1] "numeric"
class(animals)
## [1] "character"
```

The function `str()` shows us the **structure** of the object and the elements it
contains. `str()` is a really useful function when working with large and complex
objects:


```r
str(weight_g)
##  num [1:4] 50 60 65 82
str(animals)
##  chr [1:3] "mouse" "rat" "dog"
```

You can add elements to your vector by using the `c()` function:


```r

# add the number 90 to the end of the vector
weight_g <- c(weight_g, 90)

# add the number 30 to the beginning of the vector
weight_g <- c(30, weight_g)
weight_g
## [1] 30 50 60 65 82 90
```

In the examples above, you saw 2 of the 6 **atomic vector** types that `R` uses:

1. `"character"` and
2. `"numeric"`

These are the basic data tpes that all `R` objects are built
from. The other 4 are:

* `"logical"` for `TRUE` and `FALSE` (the boolean data type)
* `"integer"` for integer numbers (e.g. `2L`, the `L` indicates to R that it's an integer)
* `"complex"` to represent complex numbers with real and imaginary parts (e.g.,
  `1+4i`) and that's all we're going to say about them
* `"raw"` that we won't discuss further

## Data type vs. Data Structure
Vectors are one of the many **data structures** that `R` uses. Other important
ones include: lists (`list`), matrices (`matrix`), data frames (`data.frame`) and
factors (`factor`). You will look at `data.frames` when you open your `boulder_precip`
data in the next lesson!

* **Question**: What happens when you create a vector that contains both numbers
and character values? Give it a try and write down the answer.
<!-- * _Answer_: R implicitly converts them to all be the same type -->

* **Question**: What will happen in each of these examples? (hint: use `class()`
  to check the data type of your objects):

```r
num_char <- c(1, 2, 3, 'a')
num_logical <- c(1, 2, 3, '2.45')
char_logical <- c('a', 'b', 'c', frog)
tricky <- c(1, 2, 3, '4')
```
* **Question**: Why do you think it happens?
<!-- * _Answer_: Vectors can be of only one data type. R tries to convert (=coerce)
  the content of this vector to find a "common denominator". -->

* **Question**: Can you draw a diagram that represents the hierarchy of the data
  types?
<!-- * _Answer_: `logical -> numeric -> character <-- logical` -->

## Subsetting Vectors

If you want to extract one or several values from a vector, you must provide one
or several indices in square brackets. For instance:


```r
animals <- c("mouse", "rat", "dog", "cat")
animals[2]
## [1] "rat"
animals[c(3, 2)]
## [1] "dog" "rat"
```

<i fa fa-star></i>**Data tip:** `R` indexes start at 1. Programming languages like
`Fortran`, `MATLAB`, and `R` start counting at 1, because that's what human beings
typically do. Languages in the `C` family (including `C++`, `Java`, `Perl`, and
`Python`) count from 0 because that's simpler for computers to do.

## Subset Vectors

You can subset vectors too. For instance, if you wanted to select only the
values above 50:


```r
weight_g > 50    # will return logicals with TRUE for the indices that meet the condition
## [1] FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE
## so you can use this to select only the values above 50
weight_g[weight_g > 50]
## [1] 60 65 82 90
```

You can combine multiple tests using `&` (both conditions are true, AND) or `|`
(at least one of the conditions is true, OR):


```r
weight_g[weight_g < 30 | weight_g > 50]
## [1] 60 65 82 90
weight_g[weight_g >= 30 & weight_g == 21]
## numeric(0)
```

When working with vectors of characters, if you are trying to combine many
conditions it can become tedious to type. The function `%in%` allows you to test
if a value is found in a vector:


```r
animals <- c("mouse", "rat", "dog", "cat")
animals[animals == "cat" | animals == "rat"] # returns both rat and cat
## [1] "rat" "cat"
animals %in% c("rat", "cat", "dog", "duck")
## [1] FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE
animals[animals %in% c("rat", "cat", "dog", "duck")]
## [1] "rat" "dog" "cat"
```

* Can you figure out why `"four" > "five"` returns `TRUE`?
</div>



<!--

```r
## Answers
## * When using ">" or "<" on strings, R compares their alphabetical order. Here
##   "four" comes after "five", and therefore is "greater than" it.
