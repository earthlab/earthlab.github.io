In your week 1 homework, you used the quick plot function of `ggplot2` to plot your data.
In this tutorial, you'll explore `ggplot` - which offers many more advanced plotting
features.

Let's explore the code below to create a quick plot.


```r

# load the ggplot2 library for plotting
library(ggplot2)

# download data from figshare
# note that you already downloaded the data to your laptops previously
# but in case you don't have it - re-download it by uncommenting the code below.
# download.file("https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/9282364",
#             "data/boulder-precip.csv",
#             method = "libcurl")

# import data
boulder_precip <- read.csv(file = "data/boulder-precip.csv")

# view first few rows of the data
head(boulder_precip)
##     X       DATE PRECIP
## 1 756 2013-08-21    0.1
## 2 757 2013-08-26    0.1
## 3 758 2013-08-27    0.1
## 4 759 2013-09-01    0.0
## 5 760 2013-09-09    0.1
## 6 761 2013-09-10    1.0

# when you download the data you create a dataframe
# view each column of the data frame using its name (or header)
boulder_precip$DATE
##  [1] "2013-08-21" "2013-08-26" "2013-08-27" "2013-09-01" "2013-09-09"
##  [6] "2013-09-10" "2013-09-11" "2013-09-12" "2013-09-13" "2013-09-15"
## [11] "2013-09-16" "2013-09-22" "2013-09-23" "2013-09-27" "2013-09-28"
## [16] "2013-10-01" "2013-10-04" "2013-10-11"

# view the precip column
boulder_precip$PRECIP

# q plot stands for quick plot. Let's use it to plot your data
qplot(x = boulder_precip$DATE,
      y = boulder_precip$PRECIP)
```

## Plot with ggplot2

`ggplot2` is a plotting package that makes it simple to create complex plots
from data in a data.frame. It uses default settings, which help to create
publication quality plots with a minimal amount of settings and tweaking.

`ggplot` graphics are built step by step by adding new elements.

To build a `ggplot()` you need to:

- Bind the plot to a specific data frame using the `data` argument


```r
ggplot(data = boulder_precip)

```


- Define aesthetics (`aes`), by selecting the variables to be plotted and the variables to define the presentation
     such as plotting size, shape color, etc.,


```r
ggplot(data = boulder_precip, aes(x = DATE, y = PRECIP))
```

- Add `geoms` -- graphical representation of the data in the plot (points,
     lines, bars). To add a geom to the plot use `+` operator:


```r
ggplot(data = boulder_precip,  aes(x = DATE, y = PRECIP)) +
  geom_point()
```

<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/courses/earth-analytics-r/02-time-series-data/get-to-know-r/first-ggplot-1.png" title="ggplot boulder precip" alt="ggplot boulder precip" width="90%" />

The `+` in the `ggplot2` package is particularly useful because it allows you
to modify existing `ggplot` objects. This means you can easily set up plot
"templates" and conveniently explore different types of plots, so the above
plot can also be generated with code like this:


```r
# Create the plot object (nothing will render on your screen)
precip_plot <-  ggplot(data = boulder_precip,  aes(x = DATE, y = PRECIP))

# Draw the plot
precip_plot + geom_point()

```




You can also apply a color to your points


```r
ggplot(data = boulder_precip,  aes(x = DATE, y = PRECIP)) +
    geom_point(color = "blue")
```

<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/courses/earth-analytics-r/02-time-series-data/get-to-know-r/adding-colors-1.png" title="ggplot with blue points" alt="ggplot with blue points" width="90%" />

And adjust the transparency


```r
ggplot(data = boulder_precip,  aes(x = DATE, y = PRECIP)) +
    geom_point(alpha = .5, color = "blue")
```

<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/courses/earth-analytics-r/02-time-series-data/get-to-know-r/add-alpha-1.png" title="ggplot with blue points and alpha" alt="ggplot with blue points and alpha" width="90%" />


Or to color each value in the plot differently


```r
ggplot(data = boulder_precip,  aes(x = DATE, y = PRECIP)) +
    geom_point(alpha = 0.9, aes(color = PRECIP))
```

<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/courses/earth-analytics-r/02-time-series-data/get-to-know-r/color-by-species-1.png" title="ggplot with colored points" alt="ggplot with colored points" width="90%" />


You can turn your plot into a bar plot


```r
ggplot(data = boulder_precip,  aes(x = DATE, y = PRECIP)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity")
```

<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/courses/earth-analytics-r/02-time-series-data/get-to-know-r/barplot-1.png" title="ggplot with bars" alt="ggplot with bars" width="90%" />

Turn the bar outlines blue


```r
ggplot(data = boulder_precip,  aes(x = DATE, y = PRECIP)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity", color = "blue")
```

<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/courses/earth-analytics-r/02-time-series-data/get-to-know-r/bar-color-1.png" title="ggplot with blue bars" alt="ggplot with blue bars" width="90%" />

Or change the fill to bright green


```r
ggplot(data = boulder_precip,  aes(x = DATE, y = PRECIP)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity", color = "blue", fill = "green")
```

<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/courses/earth-analytics-r/02-time-series-data/get-to-know-r/barcolor2-1.png" title="ggplot with green bars" alt="ggplot with green bars" width="90%" />


## Add Plot Labels

You can add labels to your plots as well. Let's add a title, and x and y labels
using the glab() argument.


```r
ggplot(data = boulder_precip,  aes(x = DATE, y = PRECIP)) +
    geom_point(alpha = 0.9, aes(color = PRECIP)) +
    labs(x = "Date",
      y = "Precipitation (Inches)",
      title = "Daily Precipitation (inches)",
      subtitle = "Boulder, Colorado 2013")
```

<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/courses/earth-analytics-r/02-time-series-data/get-to-know-r/add-title-1.png" title="ggplot with labels" alt="ggplot with labels" width="90%" />

## Finally, Explore Using Themes


```r
ggplot(data = boulder_precip,  aes(x = DATE, y = PRECIP)) +
    geom_point(alpha = 0.9, aes(color = PRECIP)) +
    labs(x = "Date",
      y = "Precipitation (Inches)",
      title = "Daily Precipitation (inches)",
      subtitle = "Boulder, Colorado 2013") + theme_bw()
```

<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/courses/earth-analytics-r/02-time-series-data/get-to-know-r/add-title-theme-1.png" title="ggplot with labels and themes" alt="ggplot with labels and themes" width="90%" />

Make font size for all labels larger by setting the base size!

```r
ggplot(data = boulder_precip,  aes(x = DATE, y = PRECIP)) +
    geom_point(alpha = 0.9, aes(color = PRECIP)) +
    labs(x = "Date",
      y = "Precipitation (Inches)",
      title = "Daily Precipitation (inches)",
      subtitle = "Boulder, Colorado 2013") + theme_bw(base_size = 9)
```

<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/courses/earth-analytics-r/02-time-series-data/get-to-know-r/add-title-theme-font-1.png" title="ggplot with labels and themes" alt="ggplot with labels and themes" width="90%" />

## More on Customizing Your Plots

There are many different tutorials out there on customizing ggplot plots. A
few are listed below.

<div class="notice--warning" markdown="1">

## <i class="fa fa-pencil-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> Optional Challenge

Customize the plot that you created in last weeks homework as follows:

* Change the colors of the plot
* Plot the data using points `geom_point()` AND bars `geom_bar()`
* Add a title to your plot and x and y axis labels.
