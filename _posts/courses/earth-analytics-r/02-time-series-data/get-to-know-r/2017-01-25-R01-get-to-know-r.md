## <i class="fa fa-check-square-o fa-2" aria-hidden="true"></i> What You Need

You need `R` and `RStudio` to complete this tutorial. Also we recommend that you
have an `earth-analytics` directory set up on your computer with a `/data`
directory within it.

</div>

In the [previous module](/courses/earth-analytics/document-your-science/setup-r-rstudio), you
set up `RStudio` and `R` and got to know the `RStudio` interface.
You also created a basic `RMarkdown` report using `RStudio`. In this module, you will
explore the basic syntax of the `R` programming language. You will learn how to work
with packages and functions, how to work with vector objects in `R` and finally how
to import data into a `data.frame` which is the `R` equivalent of a spreadsheet.

Let's start by looking at the code you used in the previous module. Here you:


1. Downloaded some data from figshare using the `download.file()` function.
2. Imported the data into `R` using the `read.csv()` function.
3. Plotted the data using the `qplot()` function (which is a part of the `ggplot2` package).




```r

# load the ggplot2 library for plotting
library(ggplot2)

# turn off factors
options(stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# download data from figshare
# note that you are downloading the data into your
download.file(url = "https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/7010681",
              destfile = "data/boulder-precip.csv")

# import data
boulder_precip <- read.csv(file = "data/boulder-precip.csv")

# view first few rows of the data
head(boulder_precip)
##     X       DATE PRECIP
## 1 756 2013-08-21    0.1
## 2 757 2013-08-26    0.1
## 3 758 2013-08-27    0.1
## 4 759 2013-09-01    0.0
## 5 760 2013-09-09    0.1
## 6 761 2013-09-10    1.0

# what is the format of the variable in R
str(boulder_precip)
## 'data.frame':	18 obs. of  3 variables:
##  $ X     : int  756 757 758 759 760 761 762 763 764 765 ...
##  $ DATE  : chr  "2013-08-21" "2013-08-26" "2013-08-27" "2013-09-01" ...
##  $ PRECIP: num  0.1 0.1 0.1 0 0.1 1 2.3 9.8 1.9 1.4 ...

# q plot stands for quick plot. Let's use it to plot your data
qplot(x = boulder_precip$DATE,
      y = boulder_precip$PRECIP)
```

The code above uses syntax that is unique the `R` programming language.
Syntax is the characters or commands that `R` understands and associated
organization / format of the code including spacing and comments.

Let's break down the syntax of the code above, to better understand what it's doing.

## Intro to the R Syntax

### Assignment Operator <-

First, notice the use of `<-`. `<-` is the assignment operator. It is similar to
an equals (=) sign. It assigns values on the right to objects on the left. So,
after executing `x <- 3`, the value of `x` is `3` (`x=3`). The arrow can be read
as 3 **goes into** `x`.

In the example below, you assigned the data file that you read into `R` named `boulder-precip.csv`
to the variable name `boulder_precip`. After you run the line of code below,
what happens in `R`?


```r
# import data
boulder_precip <- read.csv(file = "data/boulder-precip.csv")

# view new object
boulder_precip
##      X       DATE PRECIP
## 1  756 2013-08-21    0.1
## 2  757 2013-08-26    0.1
## 3  758 2013-08-27    0.1
## 4  759 2013-09-01    0.0
## 5  760 2013-09-09    0.1
## 6  761 2013-09-10    1.0
## 7  762 2013-09-11    2.3
## 8  763 2013-09-12    9.8
## 9  764 2013-09-13    1.9
## 10 765 2013-09-15    1.4
## 11 766 2013-09-16    0.4
## 12 767 2013-09-22    0.1
## 13 768 2013-09-23    0.3
## 14 769 2013-09-27    0.3
## 15 770 2013-09-28    0.1
## 16 771 2013-10-01    0.0
## 17 772 2013-10-04    0.9
## 18 773 2013-10-11    0.1
```

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip:**  In RStudio, typing <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>-</kbd> (push <kbd>Alt</kbd> at the
same time as the <kbd>-</kbd> key) will write ` <- ` in a single keystroke.
{: .notice--success}

While the `=` can be used in `R`, it does not always work. Thus you will use `<-`
for all assignments in `R` from here on in. It is a recommended best practice.

When you are defining arguments for functions you do use the `=` sign. You will
learn about function arguments below.

### Comments in R (`#`)

Next, notice the use of the `#` sign in your code example.

```r
# load the ggplot2 library for plotting
library(ggplot2)
```

Use `#` sign is used to add comments to your code. A comment is a line of information
in your code that is not executed by R. Anything to the right of a `#` is ignored
by `R`. Comments are a way for you to DOCUMENT the steps of your code - both for
yourself and for others who may use your script.


### Functions and Their Arguments

Finally you have functions. Functions are "canned scripts" that automate a task
that may otherwise require typing in several lines of code.

For example:


```r
# take the square root of a value
sqrt(16)
## [1] 4
```

In the example above, the `sqrt` function is built into `R` and takes the square
root of any number that you provide to it.

## Function Arguments

A function often has one or more inputs called *arguments*. In the example above,
the value 16 was the argument that you gave to the `sqrt()` function.
Below, you use the `qplot()` function which is a part of the `ggplot2` package.
`qplot()` needs two arguments to execute properly:

1. The value that you want to plot on the `x=` axis
2. The value that you want to plot on the `y=` axis

```r
# q plot stands for quick plot. Let's use it to plot your data
qplot(x = boulder_precip$DATE,
      y = boulder_precip$PRECIP)
```

Functions return an output. Sometimes that output is a *figure* like the example
above. Sometimes it is a *value* or a set of values or even something else.

### Base Functions vs. Packages
There are a
set of functions that come with `R` when you download it. These are called `base R`
functions. Other functions are add-ons to base `R`. These functions can be loaded by

1. Installing a particular package (using install.packages() like you did when
you installed `ggplot2`, `knitr`, and `rmarkdown` and loading the library in your script using `library(package-name).
2. Writing your own functions.

### Functions that Return Values
The  `sqrt()` function is an example of a `base R` function. The input (the
argument) is a number, and the return value (the output)
is the square root of that number. Executing a function ('running it') is called
*calling* the function. An example of a function call is:

`b <- sqrt(a)`

Here, the value of `a` is given to the `sqrt()` function, the `sqrt()` function
calculates the square root, and returns the value which is then assigned to
variable `b`. This function is very simple, because it takes just one argument.


Let's run a function that can take multiple arguments: `round()`.


```r
# round a number
round(3.14159)
## [1] 3
```

Here, you've called `round()` with just one argument, `3.14159`, and it has
returned the value `3`.  That's because the default is to round to the nearest
whole number. If you want more digits you can see how to do that by getting
information about the `round` function.  You can use `args(round)` or look at the
help for this function using `?round`.


```r
# view arguments for the round function
args(round)
## function (x, digits = 0) 
## NULL
```


```r
# view help for the round function
?round
```

You see that if you want a different number of digits, you can
type `digits=2` or however many you want.


```r
round(3.14159, digits = 2)
## [1] 3.14
```

If you provide the arguments in the exact same order as they are defined you
don't have to name them:


```r
round(3.14159, 2)
## [1] 3.14
```

And if you do name the arguments, you can switch their order:


```r
round(digits = 2, x = 3.14159)
## [1] 3.14
```

It's good practice to put the non-optional arguments (like the number you're
rounding) first in your function call, and to specify the names of all optional
arguments.  If you don't, someone reading your code might have to look up
definition of a function with unfamiliar arguments to understand what you're
doing.

## Get Information About a Function

If you need help with a specific function, let's say `barplot()`, you can type:


```r
?barplot
```

If you just need to remind yourself of the names of the arguments, you can use:


```r
args(lm)
```

## <i class="fa fa-pencil-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> Optional Challenge Activity

Use the `RMarkdown` document that you created as homework for today's class. If
you don't have a document already, create a new one, naming it: "lastname-firstname-wk2.Rmd.
Add the code below in a code chunk. Edit the code that you just pasted into
your `.Rmd` document as follows:

1. The plot isn't pretty. Let's fix the x and y labels.
Look up the arguments for the `qplot()` function using either args(qplot) OR `?qplot`
in the R console. Then fix the labels of your plot in your script.

HINT: Google is your friend. Feel free to use it to help edit the code.

2. What other things can you modify to make the plot look prettier. Explore. Are
there things that you'd like to do that you can't?
