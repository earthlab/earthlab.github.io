## <i class="fa fa-ship" aria-hidden="true"></i> Welcome to Week 2!

Welcome to week {{ page.week }} of Earth Analytics! In week 02 you will learn how to work with
data in `R` and `RStudio`. We will also learn how to work with time series data.
To work with time series data you need to know how to deal with date and time fields and
missing data. It is also helpful to know how to subset the data by date.

The data that you use this week is collected by US Agency managed sensor networks.
We will use the USGS stream gage network data and
NOAA / National Weather Service precipitation data.
All of the data you work with were collected in Boulder, Colorado around the time
of the 2013 floods.

Read the assignment below carefully. Use the class and homework lessons to help
you complete the assignment.

## <i class="fa fa-pencil"></i> Homework Week 2

### 1. Download Data
[<i class="fa fa-download" aria-hidden="true"></i> Download Week 02 data](https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/7426738){:data-proofer-ignore='' .btn }

## Important - Data Organization
Before you begin this lesson, be sure that you've downloaded the dataset above.
You will need to **unzip** the zip file. When you do this, be sure that your directory
looks like the image below: note that all of the data are within the **week_02**
directory. The data are not nested within another directory. You may have to copy
and paste your files into the correct directory to make this look right.

<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/courses/earth-analytics/co-flood-lessons/week-02-data.png" alt="week 2 file organization">
</a>
<figcaption>Your `week_02` file directory should look like the one above. Note that
the data directly under the week_02 folder.</figcaption>
</figure>

### Why Data Organization Matters

It is important that your data are organized as specified in the lessons because:

1. When the instructors grade your assignments, we will be able to run your code if your directory looks like the instructors'.
1. It will be easier for you to follow along in class if your directory is the same as the instructors.
1. It is good practice to learn how to organize your files in a way that makes it easier for your future self to find and work with your data!

### 2. Videos

### 3. Install QGIS & Review Homework Lessons

Install **QGIS**. Use the install QGIS homework lesson as a guide if needed.
Then review all of the homework lessons - they will help you complete the
submission below.

<div class="notice--warning" markdown="1">

## <i class="fa fa-pencil-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> Homework (5 points): Due Friday Sept 15 @ 8pm

#### 1. Create an R Markdown Document

Create a new `R Markdown` document. Name it: `youLastName-yourFirstName-week02.rmd`

#### 2. Add the Text That You Wrote Last Week About the Flood Events

Add the text that you wrote for the first homework assignment to the top of your report.
Then think about where in that text the plots below might fit best to better describe
the events that occurred during the 2013 floods.

#### 3. Add 4 Plots to Your R Markdown Document

Add the plots described below to your `R Markdown` file. **IMPORTANT** Please add a
figure caption to each plot that describes the contents of the plot.

Add the code to produce the following 4 plots in your `R Markdown` document, [using the homework lessons as a guide to walk you through]({{site.url}}/courses/earth-analytics/time-series-data/plot-data-with-ggplot2-r/). Use the pipes syntax that you learned in
class to subset and summarize the data as required.

Use the `data/week-02/precipitation/805325-precip-dailysum-2003-2013.csv` file to create:

* **PLOT 1:** a plot of precipitation from 2003 to 2013 using the `ggplot()` function.
* **PLOT 2:** a plot that shows precipitation SUBSETTED from Aug 15 - Oct 15 2013 using the `ggplot()` function.

Use the `data/week-02/discharge/06730200-discharge-daily-1986-2013.csv` file to create:

* **PLOT 3:** a plot of stream discharge from 1986 to 2013 using `ggplot()` function.
* **PLOT 4:** a plot that shows stream discharge SUBSETTED from Aug 15 - Oct 15 2013 using the `ggplot()` function.

#### For all your plots be sure to do the following

### Label Plots Appropriately

Be sure that each plot has:

1. A figure caption that describes the contents of the plot.
2. X and Y axis labels that include appropriate units.
3. A carefully composed title that describes the contents of the plot.


Below each plot, describe and interpret what the plot shows. Describe how the
data demonstrate an impact and / or a driver of the 2013 flood event.

### Write Clean Code

Be sure that your code follows the style guidelines outlined in the
[write clean code lessons]({{ site.url }}/courses/earth-analytics/time-series-data/write-clean-code-with-r/)


Be sure to:

* Label each plot clearly. This includes a `title`, `x` and `y` axis labels.
* Write [clean code]({{ site.url }}/courses/earth-analytics/time-series-data/write-clean-code-with-r/). This includes comments that document / describe the steps you take in your code and clean syntax following <a href="http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html" target="_blank">Hadley Wickham's style guide.</a>
* Convert date fields as appropriate.
* Clean no data values as appropriate.
* Show all of your code in the output `.html` file.

#### 4. Graduate Students: Add a 5th Plot to Your .Rmd File

In addition to the plots above, add a plot of precipitation that spans
from 1948 - 2013 using the `805333-precip-daily-1948-2013.csv` file. For your plot
be sure to:

1. Subset the data temporally: Jan 1 2013 - Oct 15 2013.
2. Summarize the data: plot DAILY total (sum) precipitation.
3. Important: be sure to set the time zone as you are dealing with dates and times which are impacted by daylight saving time. Add: `tz = "America/Denver"` to any statements involving time - but specifically to the line of code where you convert date / time to just a date!


Use the [bonus lesson]({{ site.url }}/courses/earth-analytics/time-series-data/aggregate-time-series-data-r/) to guide
you through creating this plot.

#### Bonus Points (For Grads and Undergrads)

**Bonus Opportunity 1 (1 point):** Generate and add to your report the plot of precipitation for 1948 - 2013
described above (required for all graduate students).

Then, receive a bonus point for:

1. Identifying an anomaly or change in the data that you can clearly see when you plot it.
2. Suggesting how to address that anomaly in `R` to make a more uniform looking plot.

**Bonus opportunity 2 (1 point):** Create an interactive plot with a slider (range selector) using `dygraphs`

***

## Final Submission

When you are happy with your report, convert your `R Markdown` file into `.html`
format report using `knitr`.
**Submit your final report to the d2l drop box in both `.html` and `.Rmd`**
