## <i class="fa fa-ship" aria-hidden="true"></i> Welcome to Week {{ page.week }}!

Welcome to week {{ page.week }} of Earth Analytics! This week, you will explore
the concept of uncertainty surrounding lidar raster data (and remote sensing
data in general). You will use the same data that you downloaded last week for class.
You will also use pipes again this week to work with tabular data.

For your homework you'll also need to download the data below.

### Produce a Report

Create a new `R markdown `document. Name it: **lastName-firstInitial-week5.Rmd**
Within your `.Rmd` document, include the plots listed below. When you are done
with your report, use `knitr` to convert it to `html` format. Submit both the
`.Rmd` file and the `.html` file. Be sure to name your files as instructed above!

#### Use knitr Code Chunk Arguments
In your final report, use the following `knitr` code chunk arguments to hide messages
and warnings and code as you see fit.

* `message = FALSE`, `warning = FALSE` Hide warnings and messages in a code chunk
* `echo = FALSE` Hide code and just show code output
* `fig.cap = "caption here"` Add a caption to a figure. When you do this, each figure needs to be in it's own code chunk!

#### Answer Questions Below in Your Report
2. **Write *at least* 2 paragraphs:** In this class you learned the relationship between lidar derived canopy height models and measured tree height. Use that plots that you create below, the readings and the course lessons to answer the following questions
  * Which lidar tree height metric, (max vs. mean height) more closely relates to human measured tree height?
  * What sources of uncertainty (as discussed in class and the readings) may impact relationship between lidar vs human measured tree height?
  * Do you notice any differences in the relationship between the lidar vs human measured tree height between SJER vs SOAP field sites? Explain.
3. **Write *at least* 1 paragraph:** List a minimum of 3 sources of uncertainty associated with the lidar derived tree heights and 3 sources of uncertainty associated with *in situ* measurements of tree height. For each source of uncertainty, specify whether it is a random or systematic error. Be sure to reference the plots and readings as necessary.


#### Include the Plots Below
Be sure to describe what each plot shows in your final report.
Your plots do not need to be in the order below. I just listed them this way
to make it easier to keep track of and grade!

#### Plots 1 - 2

Overlay the field site point locations on top of the canopy height model for
both the SJER and the SOAP field sites.

#### Plots 3 - 6: Scatterplots

For both the SJER and SOAP field sites, create scatter plots that compare:

* **MAXIMUM** canopy height model height in meters, extracted within a 20 meter radius, compared to **MAXIMUM** tree
height derived from the in situ field site data.
* **AVERAGE** canopy height model height in meters, extracted within a 20 meter radius, compared to **AVERAGE** tree
height derived from the in situ field site data.

#### Plot 7 - 10 Difference Bar Plots
For both the SJER and SOAP field sites, create barplots that show the DIFFERENCE between:

* Extracted lidar max canopy height model height compared to measured max height per plot.
* Extracted lidar average canopy height model compared to measured average height per plot.

#### Graduate Students Only
Add a regression line to each scatterplot. For both plots write a thoughtful paragraph
describing what the regression relationship tells you about the relationship
between lidar and measured vegetation height. Does the comparison between lidar and
measured average height look stronger? Or Maximum height? Why might one be "better"
or a strong relationship than the other.

### IMPORTANT: For All Plots
* Label x and y axes appropriately - include units
* Add a title to your plot that describes what the plot shows
* Add a brief, 1-3 sentence caption below each plot that describes what it shows HINT: you can use the `knitr` argument `fig.cap = "Caption here"` if you are knitting to pdf to automatically add captions.

## Homework Due: Monday October 9th 2017 @ 8am.
Submit your report in both `.Rmd` and `.html` format to the D2l dropbox. Once again
you are welcome to submit a `.pdf` instead of `.html` if you wish!

## Report Structure, Code Syntax & Knitr Output: 10%

| Full Credit | No Credit  |
|:----|----|
| `.html` or `.pdf` and `.Rmd` files submitted | |
| Code is written using "clean" code practices following the Hadley Wickham style guide |  |
| Code chunks contain code and code runs  |  |
| All required `R` packages are listed at the top of the document in a code chunk.  | |
| Lines of code are broken up at commas to reduce the line width and make the code more readable  | |
| Code chunk arguments are used to hide warnings and code and just show output |  |
| `.html` / `.pdf` report emphasizes the write up and the code outputs rather than showing each step of the code (note we will still look at and grade your code but it should not appear in your report) |  |
