## Work With Directories of Files

In the previous lesson, you broke up a single `.csv` file into a set of csv files -
one for each year. However, what if you wanted to modify each of those `.csv` files
in some way? How would you go about it?

One option could be to open each file individually and then manipulate it.

This is:

1. Tedious and inefficient.
1. Generates lots of redundant lines of code.
1. Leaves room for lots of error.



```r
year1 <- read.csv("2003_precip.csv")
year2 <- read.csv("2004_precip.csv")
year3 <- read.csv("2005_precip.csv")
year4 <- read.csv("2006_precip.csv")
year5 <- read.csv("2007_precip.csv")
year6 <- read.csv("2008_precip.csv")

```

Another option is to generate a list of all `.csv` files in your directory. Using that
list, you can then create a `for loop`. OR you can also use an `R`, `apply` function if
you have built the correct functions that you need to process your data.

## Generate a List of Files

You can use `list.files()` to generate a list of files that you'd like to work
with. The `list.files()` function requires 2 arguments:

1. The path where the files are located on your computer.
1. The pattern that you'd like to look for in the files. For example, to find all csv files - you'd use `*.csv`. If you want to find all files with "_precip" in the name you could do that too.


```r
list.files(path = "data/week-06/",
           pattern = "*.csv")
## character(0)
```

Just find files that contain `precip-` in the filename.


```r
list.files(path = "data/week-06/",
           pattern = "precip-")
## character(0)
```

Just find files that contain `_precip` in the filename.


```r
list.files(path = "data/week-06/",
           pattern = "precip")
## character(0)
```

You get the idea...


<i class="fa fa-star" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Data Tip** you can also use `list.dirs()` to generate a list of directories rather than files.
{: .notice--success }


One you have a list of files, you can loop through each file in a `for loop`.
Note below the argument `full.names = TRUE` is used to ensure that `R` gets the
full path rather than just the filename.


```r

all_precip_files <- list.files(path = "data/week-06/",
           pattern = "precip-",
           full.names = TRUE)
# print the name of each file
for (file in all_precip_files) {
  print(file)
}
```

You can do even more now with your data. Let's loop through each `.csv` file and

1. Open the `.csv` file.
1. Add a new column to the `data.frame` that contains the precipitation in **mm**.
1. Export the `data.frame` as a new `.csv` in a new data directory (`data/week-06/outputs/precip_mm/`) with a modified file name.


The example below uses the `basename()` function to grab just the file name (without the path)
from the file variable.


```r
a_file <- "data/week-06/precip-2013.csv"
# just get the filename without the full path
basename(a_file)
## [1] "precip-2013.csv"

# create a new path to the file
paste0("data/week-06/outputs/precip_mm/", basename(a_file))
## [1] "data/week-06/outputs/precip_mm/precip-2013.csv"
```



```r
# print the name of each file
for (file in all_precip_files) {
  # read in the csv
  the_data <- read.csv(file, header = TRUE) %>%
    mutate(precip_mm = (HPCP * 25.4)) # add a column with precip in mm
  # write the csv to a new file
  write.csv(the_data, file = paste0("data/week-06/outputs/precip_mm/", basename(file)))
}
```


## Check for and Create Directories with R with 'If' Statements

You are closer to the final file output in the format that you want. However,
you can't write out the files to a new directory unless that directory exists.

You can create new directories and test to see if a directory exists in `R` too
using if statements.

An `if` statement:

1. Starts with the word, `if`.
1. Is followed by the condition that you are testing for in `()`.
1. Then the task that you want R to perform follows, in curly braces `{}`.

If the if statement condition is `TRUE` then `R` will perform the tasks in the
curly braces.

```r
# an example if statement
if (some-condition-exists) {
  perform-some-task
}
```
In your case, you'd like to test to see if a directory exists.

You can use the `dir.exists()` function to check to see if a directory exists in
your working directory or on your computer.





```r
# create an object with the directory name
new_dir <- "data/week-06/outputs/precip_mm/"
# does the dir exist?
dir.exists(new_dir)
## [1] FALSE
```

However you want to check if the directory doesn't exist. To do this, use the `!`
at the beginning of your function.


```r
# does the dir NOT exist?
!dir.exists(new_dir)
## [1] TRUE
```

Now, build your if statement.

1. First, create a directory path that you wish to check for. Use: `data/week-06/outputs/precip_mm/`.
2. Condition: Check to see if that directory path (defined in step 1) exists using `dir.exists()`.
3. Use an if statement to test whether the dir exists or not.
4. If the dir doesn't exist, then create the new directory using `dir.create()`. Use the `recursive = TRUE` function argument to ensure that R creates not only the prec_mm dir but also the outputs directory.

Like this:


```r
# if the dir doesn't exist, create it
if (!dir.exists(new_dir)) {
  dir.create(new_dir, recursive = TRUE)
}
```

You are now ready to complete the homework for week 6!
