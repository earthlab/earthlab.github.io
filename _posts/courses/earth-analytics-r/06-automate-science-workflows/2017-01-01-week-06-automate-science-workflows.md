## <i class="fa fa-ship" aria-hidden="true"></i> Welcome to Week {{ page.week }}!

Welcome to week {{ page.week }} of Earth Analytics! This week you will learn about
efficient coding practices. Specifically, you will learn how to use functions to
make our code:

* Simpler and easier to read.
* More modular.
* More efficient.

You will also learn the DRY principle of programming - Don't Repeat Yourself.

## <i class="fa fa-pencil-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> Homework Submission

### Produce a R Markdown Report

Create a new `R markdown `document. Name it: **lastName-firstInitial-week6.Rmd**
Within your `.Rmd` document, include the plots listed below. When you are done
with your report, use `knitr` to convert it to `html` format. Submit both the
`.Rmd` file and the `.html` (or `.pdf` file to D2L. Be sure to name your files
as instructed above!

#### Use knitr Code Chunk Arguments

For this week's assignment **please do not hide your code**. We will grade the
assignment based upon your use of functions and for loops to complete your assignment.

#### Answer the Following Questions Below in Your Report

1. Define the acronym **DRY**. What does DRY mean?
1. When you document a function, what elements should you include?
1. Provide an example of a function name that is expressive vs one that is not expressive.
1. Explain the key difference between a variable that you create when programming line by line compared to a variable that is created within a function. Use the example below to help you answer the question OR use code to answer the question.

```r
# this code below should help you answer question 3.
my_variable <- 1+2

# and a variable created within a function
the_answer <- function(num1, num2){
  # calculate sum
  my_variable2 <- num1 + num2
  return(my_variable)
  }

# given the code above, will the code below run or return an error? Why?
`my_variable2`
```

#### Code Assignment

**PART ONE:**

For this week's assignment, write some code that does the following.

1. Write a `for loop` that breaks up the file: `"data/week-02/precipitation/805325-precip-daily-2003-2013.csv"` into yearly `.csv` files.
2. Each `.csv` file should be saved in `data/week-06/`.
3. Each `.csv` file should contain a `month` column with the month specified as a numeric value between 1-12.


```r
# read in the data - but be sure to address na values when you read it in here!
boulder_precip <- read.csv("path-here-dont-forget-na-arguments")

# fix the date using dplyr pipes


# define min and max year

# build your loop
for (the_year in min_yr:max_yr) {
    # use pipes to filter the data by year


   # export a .csv file with the year in the name to your data/week-06/ dir
}
```

HINT: If you followed along in class, then you have already written this code! [This lesson will help you complete this task. ]({{ site.url }}/courses/earth-analytics/automate-science-workflows/create-for-loops-r/)


**PART TWO:**

For each of the `.csv` files that you created above:

1. Create a new `.csv` file that contains the total **monthly** precipitation in mm.
2. Name that file `data/week-06/outputs/precip_mm/precip-year.csv` - note that you will need to make new directories to save the file to the path listed.

An example of what the final data should look like is below:


```r
# open data
precip_2003 <- read.csv("data/week-06/outputs/precip_mm/precip-2003.csv")
head(precip_2003, n = 6)
```

Use functions to complete this task as follows:

1. Create a function called `check_create_dir()` that takes a path to a directory that you want to make and checks to see if it exists and then creates it if it doesn't exist.
2. Create a function called `in_to_mm()` that converts values in inches to mm (you did this in an earlier lesson so you may already have this function in your code).

NOTES:

* Be sure to consider `NA` values in your data (e.g. 999.99) when you read your data!
* Make sure you address `NA` values when you run the `sum()` function.
* When you write the `.csv` make sure that you address `NA` values!


```r

check_create_dir <- function(dir_path){
  # document your function here

  # include the code required to check for the directory and then create it here
  # because this function is just creating a directory, you don't need to return anything!

}

in_to_mm <- function(precip_in){
  # document your function here

  # include the code required to convert inches to mm here

  return(precip_mm)
}

# create an object with the directory name
new_dir <- "data/week-06/outputs/precip_mm/"
# check to see if the directory exists - make it if it doesn't
check_create_dir(new_dir)

# print the name of each file
for (file in all_precip_files) {
  # read in the csv - be sure to fill in the na strings argument - i didn't do that below
  the_data <- read.csv(file, header = TRUE, na.strings = 999.99) %>%
    mutate(precip_mm = in_to_mm(HPCP)) # add a column with precip in mm and a column with just the month using the month() function
    # group the data by month

    # summarise using the sum function - be sure you address na values when you sum! we discussed this during week 1

  # write output to a new .csv file
  write_csv(the_data, path = paste0("data/week-06/outputs/precip_mm/", basename(file)))
}
```




#### Bonus Opportunity - 1 point

Use the `lapply()` function (instead of a for loop) to

1. Process all of the precipitation data files files that you created for each year.
2. Add a new column to the file containing anything that you'd like.
3. Write a new `.csv` file to a new directory with that output file.

You can chose to use the same code that you used for the homework assignment, however
implemented in a for loop if you want.

## Homework Due: Monday October 16 2017 @ 8AM.
Submit your report in both `.Rmd` and `.html` format to the D2L dropbox.
