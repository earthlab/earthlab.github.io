## Calculate Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR)

The Normalized burn ratio (NBR) is used to identify burned areas. The formula
is similar to a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), except that it
uses near-infrared (NIR) and shortwave-infrared (SWIR) portions of the
electromagnetic spectrum (Lopez, 1991; Key and Benson, 1995).

    <figcaption>The normalized burn ratio (NBR) index uses the shortwave-infrared (SWIR) and near-infrared (NIR) portions of the electromagnetic
    spectrum.

</figure>

The NIR and SWIR parts of the electromagnetic spectrum are a powerful combination
of bands to use for this index given vegetation reflects strongly in the NIR region
of the electromagnetic spectrum and weekly in the SWIR. Alternatively, it has been
shown that a fire scar which contains scarred woody vegetation and earth will
reflect more strongly in the SWIR part of the electromagnetic spectrum and beyond
(see figure below).

    <figcaption>Plants reflect strongly in the NIR portion of the spectrum but
    spectrun. reflect much less strongly in the SWIR portion which makes this combination powerful for identifying areas with standing dead stems (fire scarred wood / bark) and soil / earth. Source: US Forest Service

## NBR Bands

The NBR index was originally developed for use with Landsat TM and ETM+ bands 4 and 7,
but it will work with any multispectral sensor with a NIR
band between **760 - 900 nm** and a SWIR band between **2080 - 2350 nm**. Thus this
index can be used with both Landsat 8, MODIS and other multi (and hyper) spectral
sensors.

## Difference NBR

The Normalized Burn Ratio is most powerful as a tool to better understand fire
extent and severity when used after calculating the difference between pre and post
fire conditions. This
difference is best measured using data collected immediately before the fire and
then immediately after the fire.
NBR is less effective if time has passed and vegetation regrowth / regeneration
has begun after the fire. Once vegetation regeneration has begun, the fire scar will begin
to reflect a stronger signal in the NIR portion of the spectrum because
healthy plants reflect strongly in the NIR portion due to the properties of
chlorophyll).

For this reason, the NBR ratio works better in areas like the United States where
plant regeneration is expected to occur more slowly. In areas like the tropics
which are wet and characterized by rapid regrowth, NBR may be less effective.

To calculate the difference NBR, you subtract the post-fire NBR raster from the pre-fire
NBR raster as follows:

    </figcaption>
</figure>

The classification table below can be used to classify the difference raster according to
the severity of the burn.

| SEVERITY LEVEL  | | dNBR RANGE |
|------------------------------|
| Enhanced Regrowth | | < -.1 |
| Unburned       |  | -.1 to +.1 |
| Low Severity     | | +.1 to +.27 |
| Moderate Severity  | | +.27 to +.66 |
|===
| High Severity     |  | > .66 |

### How Severe is Severe?

It is important to keep in mind that that the classification table above is one
quantitative interpretation of what the results of dNBR actually mean. The term
"severity" is a qualitative term that could be quantified in different ways.
For instance, who is to say that .5 couldn't be representative of "high severity"
vs .66?

As scientists, the best way to make sure your classification approaches represent
what is actually happening on the ground in terms of fire severity is to check
out the actual conditions on the ground. This process of confirming a value that
you get from remote sensing data by checking it on the ground is called validation.

You learned about ground validation as it applies to lidar data [in the lidar remote sensing uncertainty lessons]({{ site.url }}/courses/earth-analytics/remote-sensing-uncertainty/).

### NBR & Water - False Positives

The NBR index can be a powerful tool to identify pixels that have a high likelyhood
or being "burned". However it is important to know that this index is also
sensitive to water and thus sometimes, pixels that are classified as "high severity"
may actually be water. Because of this, it is important to mask out areas of water
PRIOR to performing any quantitative analysis on the difference NBR results.

### NBR & Landsat 8

The table below which shows the band distribution of Landsat 8. These bands
are different from Landsat 7. What
bands should you use to calculate NBR using Landsat 8?

#### Landsat 8 Bands

| Band | Wavelength range (nanometers) | Spatial Resolution (m) | Spectral Width (nm)|
|-------------------------------------|------------------|--------------------|----------------|
| Band 1 - Coastal aerosol | 430 - 450 | 30 | 2.0 |
| Band 2 - Blue | 450 - 510 | 30 | 6.0 |
| Band 3 - Green | 530 - 590 | 30 | 6.0 |
| Band 4 - Red | 640 - 670 | 30 | 0.03 |
| Band 5 - Near Infrared (NIR) | 850 - 880 | 30 | 3.0 |
| Band 6 - SWIR 1 | 1570 - 1650 | 30 | 8.0  |
| Band 7 - SWIR 2 | 2110 - 2290 | 30 | 18 |
| Band 8 - Panchromatic | 500 - 680 | 15 | 18 |
| Band 9 - Cirrus | 1360 - 1380 | 30 | 2.0 |


### NBR & MODIS

Similarly the table below shows the band ranges for the MODIS sensor. What bands
should you use to calculate NBR using MODIS?

| Band | Wavelength range (nm) | Spatial Resolution (m) | Spectral Width (nm)|
|-------------------------------------|------------------|--------------------|----------------|
| Band 1 - red | 620 - 670 | 250 | 2.0 |
| Band 2 - near infrared | 841 - 876 | 250 | 6.0 |
| Band 3 -  blue/green | 459 - 479 | 500 | 6.0 |
| Band 4 - green | 545 - 565 | 500 | 3.0 |
| Band 5 - near infrared  | 1230 – 1250 | 500 | 8.0  |
| Band 6 - mid-infrared | 1628 – 1652 | 500 | 18 |
| Band 7 - mid-infrared | 2105 - 2155 | 500 | 18 |


1. Import the prefire raster






```
## OGR data source with driver: ESRI Shapefile 
## Source: "/root/earth-analytics/data/week-08/vector_layers/fire-boundary-geomac", layer: "co_cold_springs_20160711_2200_dd83"
## with 1 features
## It has 21 fields
```

```r
# bands 7 and 5
landsat_prefire_nbr <- overlay(all_landsat_bands_173_br[[7]], all_landsat_bands_173_br[[5]],
        fun = normalized_diff)

plot(landsat_prefire_nbr,
     main = "Landsat-derived NBR\n Pre-Fire \n with fire boundary overlay",
     axes = FALSE,
     box = FALSE)
plot(fire_boundary_utm,
     add = TRUE)
```

<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/courses/earth-analytics-r/08-multispectral-remote-sensing-fire/in-class/2017-03-01-fire04-difference-normalized-burn-ratio-vegetation-indices-R/nbr-pre-fire-1.png" title="Pre fire landsat derived NBR plot" alt="Pre fire landsat derived NBR plot" width="90%" />

Now you can calculate the difference NBR (pre fire minus post fire )


```r

diff_nbr <- landsat_prefire_nbr - landsat_postfire_nbr
```

When you have calculated NBR - classify the output raster using the `classify()`
function and the classes below.

| SEVERITY LEVEL  | | dNBR RANGE |
|------------------------------|
| Enhanced Regrowth | |   > -.1 |
| Unburned       |  | -.1 to + .1 |
| Low Severity     | | +.1 to +.27 |
| Moderate Severity  | | +.27 to +.66 |
| High Severity     |  |  > +.66  |

NOTE: your min an max values for NBR may be slightly different from the table
shown above! If you have a smaller min value (< -700) then adjust your first class
to that smallest number. If you have a largest max value (>1300) then adjust
your last class to that largest value in your data.

Alternatively, you can set those values to NA if you think they are outside of
the valid range of NBR (in this case they are not).



You `R` classified map should look something like:

```r
barplot(nbr_classified,
        main = "Distribution of Classified NBR Values",
        col = the_colors,
        names.arg = c("Enhanced \nRegrowth", "Unburned", "Low \n Severity", "Moderate \n Severity", "High \nSeverity"))
```
