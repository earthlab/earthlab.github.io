## Automating Report Content

Let's pretend that you've calculated a value in your code and you want to include
it in your R Markdown report but you don't want to include the code. Maybe it's a
number that you want to appear in the TEXT of your report - not as a code chunk
output. How do you do that?



```r

total_area <- (800 * 7) / 2
```

You can add any variable that you want to a report using the syntax

`"r total_area"`

However replace the double quotes "" with ticks <kbd>`</kbd>


There are **2800 km** of burned area according to modis.

Where the markdown text is surrounded by ticks. Followed by the language "r"
and then the variable that you want to print in your report! This is very useful
when you are trying to create a fully automated report. As you update the data,
the output numbers if your report also update!
