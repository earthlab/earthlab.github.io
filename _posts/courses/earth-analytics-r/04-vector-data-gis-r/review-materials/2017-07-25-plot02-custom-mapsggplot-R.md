## Making Maps with GGPLOT

In the previous lesson, you used base `plot()` to create a map of vector data -
your roads data - in `R`. In this lesson you will create the same maps, however
instead you will use `ggplot()`. `ggplot` is a powerful tool for making custom maps.
Compared to base plot, you will find creating custom legends to be simpler and cleaner,
and creating nicely formatted themed maps to be simpler as well.

However, you will have to convert your data from spatial (`sp`) objects to `data.frame`s
to use `ggplot`. The process isn't bad once you have the steps down! Let's check
it out.

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip:** If your data attribute values are not
read in as factors, you can convert the categorical
attribute values using `as.factor()`.
{: .notice--success}



First, let's import all of the needed libraries.


```r
# load libraries
library(raster)
library(rgdal)
library(ggplot2)
library(broom)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(rgeos)
library(dplyr)
# note that you don't need to call maptools to run the code below but it needs to be installed.
library(maptools)
# to add a north arrow and a scale bar to the map
library(ggsn)
# set factors to false
options(stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

Next, import and explore the data.



```r
# import roads
sjer_roads <- readOGR("data/week-04/california/madera-county-roads/tl_2013_06039_roads.shp")
```

View attributes of and plot the data.


```r
# view the original class of the TYPE column
class(sjer_roads$RTTYP)
## [1] "character"
unique(sjer_roads$RTTYP)
## [1] "M" NA  "S" "C"
# quick plot using base plot
plot(sjer_roads,
     main = "Quick plot of roads data")
```

<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/courses/earth-analytics-r/04-vector-data-gis-r/review-materials/convert-to-factor-1.png" title="Quick plot of the roads data." alt="Quick plot of the roads data." width="90%" />




It looks like you have some missing values in your road types. You want to plot all
road types even those that are `NA`. Let's change the roads with an `RTTYP` attribute
of `NA` to "unknown".


```r
# set all NA values to "unknown" so they still plot
sjer_roads$RTTYP[is.na(sjer_roads$RTTYP)] <- "Unknown"
unique(sjer_roads$RTTYP)
## [1] "M"       "Unknown" "S"       "C"
```

## Convert Spatial Data to a data.frame

When you're plotting with base `plot()`, you can plot spatial `sp` or `raster` objects directly
without converting them. However `ggplot()` requires a `data.frame`. Thus you will
need to convert your data. You can convert he data using the `tidy()` function from
the broom package in `R`.

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip:** The tidy function used to be the fortify
function! The code for the `tidy()` function is exactly the same as the `fortify()` code.
{: .notice--success}

Below you convert the data by:

1. Calling the `tidy()` function on your `sjer_roads` spatial object.
1. Adding an `id` field to the spatial object data frame which represents each unique
feature (each road line) in the data.
1. Joining the table from the spatial object to the data.frame output of the `tidy()` function.

Let's convert your spatial object to a `data.frame`.


```r
# convert spatial object to a ggplot ready data frame
sjer_roads_df <- tidy(sjer_roads, region = "id")
# make sure the shapefile attribute table has an id column
sjer_roads$id <- rownames(sjer_roads@data)
# join the attribute table from the spatial object to the new data frame
sjer_roads_df <- left_join(sjer_roads_df,
                           sjer_roads@data,
                           by = "id")
```

Once you've done this, you are ready to plot with `ggplot()`. Note the following when
you plot.

1. The x and y values are long and lat. These are columns that the `tidy()` function
generates from a spatial object.
1. The group function allows `R` to figure out what vertices below to which feature.
So in this case you are plotting lines - each of which consist of 2 or more vertices
that are connected.


```r
# plot the lines data, apply a diff color to each factor level)
ggplot() +
  geom_path(data = sjer_roads_df, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) +
  labs(title = "ggplot map of roads")
```

<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/courses/earth-analytics-r/04-vector-data-gis-r/review-materials/plot-roads-data-1.png" title="Basic ggplot of roads." alt="Basic ggplot of roads." width="90%" />

You can color each line by type too by adding the attribute that you wish to use
for categories or types to the color  = argument.

Below you set the colors to `color = factor(RTTYP)`. Note that you are coercing the
attribute `RTTYP` to a factor. You can think of this as temporarily grouping the
data by the `RTTYP` category for plotting purposes only. You aren't modifying the
data you are just telling `ggplot` that the data are categorical with explicit groups.


```r
# plot roads by attribute
ggplot() +
  geom_path(data = sjer_roads_df, aes(x = long, y = lat,
                                      group = group, color = factor(RTTYP))) +
labs(color = 'Road Types', # change the legend type
     title = "Roads colored by the RTTP attribute")
```

<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/courses/earth-analytics-r/04-vector-data-gis-r/review-materials/roads-axis-cleaned-1.png" title="Basic plot with title and legend title" alt="Basic plot with title and legend title" width="90%" />

You can customize the colors on your map too. Below you do a few things:

1. Figure out how many unique road types you have.
1. Specify the colors that you want to apply to each road type.
1. Finally you plot the data - you will use the `scale_colour_manual(values = c("rdType1" = "color1", "rdType2" = "color2", "rdType3" = "color3", "rdType4" = "color4"))` to specify what colors you want to use for what attribute value.

Let's plot your roads data by the `RTTYP` attribute and apply unique colors.


```r
# count the number of unique values or levels
length(levels(sjer_roads$RTTYP))
## [1] 0

# create a color palette of 4 colors - one for each factor level
road_palette <- c("C" = "green",
                  "M" = "grey40",
                  "S" = "purple",
                  "Unknown" = "grey")
road_palette
##        C        M        S  Unknown 
##  "green" "grey40" "purple"   "grey"

# plot with custom colors
# size adjusts the line width
ggplot() +
  geom_path(data = sjer_roads_df, aes(x = long, y = lat,
                                      group = group, color=factor(RTTYP))) +
      scale_colour_manual(values = road_palette) +
  labs(title = "Madera County Roads ",
       subtitle = "Colored by road type")
```

<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/courses/earth-analytics-r/04-vector-data-gis-r/review-materials/palette-and-plot-1.png" title="Adjust colors on map by creating a palette." alt="Adjust colors on map by creating a palette." width="90%" />

Notice that above the colors are applied to each category (C, M, S and Unknown) in order.
In this case the order is alphabetical.

### Remove ggplot Axis Ticks

Finally you can remove the axis ticks and labels using a `theme()` element.
Themes are used in `ggplot()` to customize the look of a plot. You can customize
any element of the plot including fonts, colors and more!

Below you do the following:

1. Remove the x and y axis ticks and label using the theme argument.
1. Remove the x and y labels using the `x =` and `y =` arguments in the `labs()` function.
3. Customize the legend title using labs(`color =`).

Let's give it a try.


```r
# size adjusts the line widht
ggplot() +
  geom_path(data = sjer_roads_df, aes(x = long, y = lat,
                                      group = group, color = factor(RTTYP))) +
      scale_colour_manual(values = road_palette) +
  labs(title = "Madera County Roads ",
       subtitle = "Colored by road type",
       color = "Road type",
       x = "", y = "") +
  theme(axis.text = element_blank(), axis.ticks = element_blank())
```

<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/courses/earth-analytics-r/04-vector-data-gis-r/review-materials/roads-axis-cleand-1.png" title="Roads ggplot map with axes customized." alt="Roads ggplot map with axes customized." width="90%" />

Finally you can use `coord_quickmap()` to scale the x and y axis equally by long and
lat values.

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip:** There are many different ways to ensure
`ggplot()` plots data using x and y axis distances that represent the data properly.
`coord_fixed()` can be used to specify a uniform x and y axis scale. `coord_quickmap()`
quickly adjusts the x and y axis scales using an estimated value of the coordinate
reference system that your data are in. `coord_map` can be used to handle proper
projections that you specify as arguments within the `coord_map()` function.
{: .notice--success }


```r
# size adjusts the line width
ggplot() +
  geom_path(data = sjer_roads_df, aes(x = long, y = lat,
                                      group = group, color = factor(RTTYP))) +
      scale_colour_manual(values = road_palette) +
  labs(title = "Madera County Roads ",
       subtitle = "Colored by road type",
       color = "Road type",
       x = "", y = "") +
  theme(axis.text = element_blank(), axis.ticks = element_blank()) +
  coord_quickmap()
```

<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/courses/earth-analytics-r/04-vector-data-gis-r/review-materials/roads-ratio-1.png" title="Roads ggplot map with aspect ratio fixed." alt="Roads ggplot map with aspect ratio fixed." width="90%" />

-->

### Adjust Line Width
You can adjust the width of the lines on your plot using `size =`. If you use `size = 4`
with a numeric value (e.g. 4) then you set all of line features in your data to the
same size.


```r
# size adjusts the line widht
ggplot() +
  geom_path(data = sjer_roads_df, aes(x = long, y = lat,
                                      group = group, color = factor(RTTYP)), size = 1.1) +
      scale_colour_manual(values = road_palette) +
  labs(title = "Madera County Roads ",
       subtitle = "With big fat lines!",
       color = "Road type",
       x = "", y = "") +
  theme(axis.text = element_blank(), axis.ticks = element_blank()) +
  coord_fixed()
```

<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/courses/earth-analytics-r/04-vector-data-gis-r/review-materials/roads-line-width-1.png" title="Roads ggplot map with line width set." alt="Roads ggplot map with line width set." width="90%" />

### Adjust Line Width by Attribute

If you want a unique line width for each factor level or attribute category
in your spatial object, you can use a similar syntax to the one you used for colors.
Here you use `scale_size_manual()` to set the line width for each category in the
`RTTYP` attribute. Similar to the colors set above, `ggplot()` will apply the line
width in the order of the factor levels in the data. This is by default alphabetical.

`scale_size_manual(values = c(.5, 1, 1, .5))`

However it's better to be explicit and set which attribute value should be
associated with each line width. Like this:

`scale_size_manual(values = c("C" = .5, "M" = 1, "S" = 1, "Unknown" = .5))`


Note that similar to colors, you have adjusted the lines using two steps

1. You've set the size to `factor(RTTYP)`.
2. You've assigned the size using the `size_scale_manual()` function.

Let's see how it looks.


```r
# size adjusts the line width
# still not working as expected - why does it plot 2 legends
# using size for a discrete variable is not advised error -- need to figure this out?
ggplot() +
  geom_path(data = sjer_roads_df, aes(x = long, y = lat,
                                      group = group,
                                      colour = factor(RTTYP),
                                      size = factor(RTTYP))) +
  scale_size_manual(values = c("C" = .5, "M" = 1, "S" = 1, "Unknown" = .5)) +
      scale_colour_manual(values = road_palette) +
  labs(title = "Madera County Roads ",
       subtitle = "With big fat lines!",
       color = "Road type",
       x = "", y = "") +
  theme(axis.text = element_blank(), axis.ticks = element_blank()) +
  coord_fixed()
```

<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/courses/earth-analytics-r/04-vector-data-gis-r/review-materials/roads-line-width2-1.png" title="Roads ggplot map with line width set." alt="Roads ggplot map with line width set." width="90%" />

### Merge the Legends

The map above looks ok but you have multiple legends when you really just want one
legend for both color and size. You can merge the legend using the `guides()` function.
Here you specify each legend element that you wish to merge together as follows:

`guides(colour = guide_legend("Legend title here"), size = guide_legend("Same legend title here"))`



```r
# size adjusts the line width
# still not working as expected - why does it plot 2 legends
# using size for a discrete variable is not advised error -- need to figure this out?
ggplot() +
  geom_path(data = sjer_roads_df, aes(x = long, y = lat,
                                      group = group,
                                      colour = factor(RTTYP),
                                      size = factor(RTTYP))) +
  scale_size_manual(values = c(.5, 1, 1, .5)) +
      scale_colour_manual(values = road_palette) +
  guides(colour = guide_legend("Road Type"), size = guide_legend("Road Type")) +
  labs(title = "Madera County Roads ",
       subtitle = "With big fat lines!",
       color = "Road type",
       x = "", y = "") +
  theme(axis.text = element_blank(), axis.ticks = element_blank()) +
  coord_fixed()
```

<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/courses/earth-analytics-r/04-vector-data-gis-r/review-materials/roads-line-width-custom-1.png" title="Roads ggplot map with line width set." alt="Roads ggplot map with line width set." width="90%" />

But this is ugly, right? Let's make the line widths a bit thinner to clean
things up.


```r
# size adjusts the line width
# still not working as expected - why does it plot 2 legends
# using size for a discrete variable is not advised error -- need to figure this out?
ggplot() +
  geom_path(data = sjer_roads_df, aes(x = long, y = lat,
                                      group = group,
                                      colour = factor(RTTYP),
                                      size = factor(RTTYP))) +
  scale_size_manual(values = c("C" = .3, "M" = .6, "S" = .6, "Unknown" = .3)) +
      scale_colour_manual(values = road_palette) +
  guides(colour = guide_legend("Road Type"), size = guide_legend("Road Type")) +
  labs(title = "Madera County Roads ",
       subtitle = "With thinner lines (by attribute)!",
       color = "Road type",
       x = "", y = "") +
  theme(axis.text = element_blank(), axis.ticks = element_blank()) +
  coord_fixed()
```

## Adding Points and Lines to a Legend

Next, let's add points to your map and and of course the map legend too.
You will import the shapefile `data/week-04/california/SJER/vector_data/sjer_plot_centroids.shp` layer. This
data represents study plot locations from your field work in southern
California.

Let's import that data and perform any cleanup that is required.



```r
# import points layer
sjer_plots <- readOGR("data/week-04/california/SJER/vector_data",
                      "SJER_plot_centroids")
# given you want to plot 2 layers together, let's check the crs before going any further
crs(sjer_plots)
crs(sjer_roads)

# reproject to lat / long
sjer_plots <- spTransform(sjer_plots, crs(sjer_roads))
```

Next you can `tidy()` up the data as you did before... or can you?


```r
sjer_plots_df <- tidy(sjer_plots, region = "id")
```

Note that this time you imported point data. You can't use the tidy function
on points data. Instead, you simply convert it to a data.frame using the function
`as.data.frame`.



```r
# convert spatial object to a ggplot ready data frame
sjer_plots_df <- as.data.frame(sjer_plots, region = "id")
```

Next, let's plot the data using `ggplot`.



```r
# plot point data using ggplot
ggplot() +
  geom_point(data = sjer_plots_df, aes(x = coords.x1, y = coords.x2)) +
  labs(title = "Plot locations")
```

<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/courses/earth-analytics-r/04-vector-data-gis-r/review-materials/ggplot-points-1.png" title="ggplot with points" alt="ggplot with points" width="90%" />

Great! You've now plotted your data using `ggplot`. Let's next combine the roads
with the points in one clean map.

## Layering Data in ggplot

You can layer multiple `ggplot` objects by adding a new `geom_` function to your plot.
For the roads data, you used `geom_path()` and for points you use `geom_point()`.
Note that you add an addition data layer to your ggplot map using the `+` sign.


```r
# plot lines and points together
ggplot() +
  geom_path(data = sjer_roads_df, aes(x = long,
                                      y = lat, group = group),
            color = "grey") +
  geom_point(data = sjer_plots_df, aes(x = coords.x1, y = coords.x2))
```

<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/courses/earth-analytics-r/04-vector-data-gis-r/review-materials/combine-layers-1.png" title="Plot of both points and lines with ggplot" alt="Plot of both points and lines with ggplot" width="90%" />


Next you have a few options - your roads layer is a much larger spatial extent
compared to your plots layer. You could zoom in on your map using `coord_fixed()`


```r
# plot with ggplot adjusting the extent with coord_fixed()
ggplot() +
  geom_path(data = sjer_roads_df, aes(x = long,
                                      y = lat, group = group),
            color = "grey") +
  geom_point(data = sjer_plots_df, aes(x = coords.x1, y = coords.x2)) +
  coord_fixed(xlim = c(-119.8, -119.7), ylim = c(37.05, 37.15))
```

<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/courses/earth-analytics-r/04-vector-data-gis-r/review-materials/combine-layers-custom-ext-1.png" title="Plot of both points and lines with ggplot with custom extent" alt="Plot of both points and lines with ggplot with custom extent" width="90%" />

## Data Crop vs. Map Zoom

A better approach is to crop your data to a study region. That way you aren't
retaining information that you done need which will make plotting faster.

Let's walk through the steps that you did above, this time cropping and cleaning up
your data as you go.


```r
# import all layers
study_area <- readOGR("data/week-04/california/SJER/vector_data/SJER_crop.shp")
sjer_plots <- readOGR("data/week-04/california/SJER/vector_data/SJER_plot_centroids.shp")
sjer_roads <- readOGR("data/week-04/california/madera-county-roads/tl_2013_06039_roads.shp")
```

Then explore the data to determine whether you need to clean the data up.


```r
# view crs of all layers
crs(study_area)
## CRS arguments:
##  +proj=utm +zone=11 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs +ellps=WGS84
## +towgs84=0,0,0
crs(sjer_plots)
## CRS arguments:
##  +proj=utm +zone=11 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs +ellps=WGS84
## +towgs84=0,0,0
crs(sjer_roads)
## CRS arguments:
##  +proj=longlat +ellps=GRS80 +towgs84=0,0,0,0,0,0,0 +no_defs
```

It looks like your data are not all in the same coordinate reference system (`CRS`).
Let's go ahead and reproject the data so they are in the same `CRS`. Also below
you spatially CROP the roads data since you only need road information for your
study area. This will also making plotting faster.


```r
# reproject the roads to utm
sjer_roads_utm <- spTransform(sjer_roads, CRS = crs(study_area))

# assign NA values in the roads layer to "unknown" so you can plot all lines
sjer_roads_utm$RTTYP[is.na(sjer_roads_utm$RTTYP)] <- "Unknown"
unique(sjer_roads_utm$RTTYP)
## [1] "M"       "Unknown" "S"       "C"

# crop the roads data to your study area for quicker plotting
sjer_roads_utmcrop <- crop(sjer_roads_utm, study_area)

# quick plot to make sure the data look like you expect them too post crop
plot(sjer_roads_utmcrop)
```

```r

# view crs of all layers

```

Next, you convert the `study_area` spatial object to a `data.frame` so you can plot it
using `ggplot`. In this case you only have one extent boundary for the study area -
so you won't need to add the attributes.


```r
# convert study area data into data.frame
study_area$id <- rownames(study_area@data)
study_area_df <- tidy(study_area, region = "id")

# convert roads layer to ggplot ready data.frame
sjer_roads_df <- tidy(sjer_roads_utmcrop, region = "id")

# make sure the shapefile attribute table has an id column so you can add spatial attributes
sjer_roads_utmcrop$id <- rownames(sjer_roads_utmcrop@data)
# join the attribute table from the spatial object to the new data frame
sjer_roads_df <- left_join(sjer_roads_df,
                           sjer_roads_utmcrop@data,
                           by = "id")


# convert spatial object to a ggplot ready data frame - note this is a points layer
# so you don't use the tidy function
sjer_plots_df <- as.data.frame(sjer_plots, region = "id")
```

Now that you have all of your layers converted and cleaned up you can plot them.
Notice that plotting is much faster when you crop the data to only the study location
that you are interested in.



```r
# plot using ggplot
ggplot() +
  geom_polygon(data = study_area_df, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group),
               fill = "white", color = "black") +
  geom_path(data = sjer_roads_df, aes(x = long, y = lat,
                                      group = group, colour = factor(RTTYP))) +
  geom_point(data = sjer_plots_df, aes(x = coords.x1,
                                       y = coords.x2), shape = 18) +
  labs(title = "GGPLOT map of roads, study area and plot locations")
```

  #scale_colour_manual(values = c("purple", "green", "blue", "yellow", "magenta"),
   #                    guide = guide_legend(override.aes = list(
    #                     linetype = c(rep("blank", 4), "solid", "dashed"),
     #                    shape = c(rep(1, 7), NA, NA))))
  # sguide_legend(override.aes = list(shape = 22))

# guide_legend(override.aes = list(shape = 22, size = 5))) something like this to make it plot correctly
-->

Finally, let's clean up your map even more. That's apply unique symbols to your plots
using the `plot_type` attribute. Note that it can be difficult to apply unique colors
to multiple object types in a `ggplot` map. Thus you will keep your symbology simple.
Let's make all of the roads the same width and map colors and symbols to the plot
locations only. The plot locations are what you want to stand out anyway!


```r
# plot ggplot
ggplot() +
  geom_polygon(data = study_area_df, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group),
               fill = "white", color = "black") +
  geom_path(data = sjer_roads_df, aes(x = long, y = lat,
                                      group = group, size = factor(RTTYP)), colour = "grey") +
  scale_size_manual("Road Type", values = c("M" = .3,
                                            "S" = .8,
                                            "Unknown" = .3)) +
  geom_point(data = sjer_plots_df, aes(x = coords.x1,
                                       y = coords.x2, shape = factor(plot_type), color = factor(plot_type)), size = 3) +
  scale_color_manual("Plot Type", values = c("trees" = "darkgreen",
                                 "grass" = "darkgreen",
                                 "soil" = "brown")) +
  scale_shape_manual("Plot Type", values = c("grass" = 18,
                                             "soil" = 15,
                                             "trees" = 8)) +
  labs(title = "ggplot map of roads, plots and study area") +
  theme_bw()
```

Finally, let's clean up your map further. You can use some of the built in functionality
of `cowplot` to adjust the `theme()` settings in `ggplot`.

NOTE: `cowplot` does the SAME things that you can do with `theme()` in `ggplot`. It just
simplies the code that you need to clean up your plot! By default it removes the
grey background on your plots. However let's adjust it even further.



```r
# plot ggplot
ggplot() +
  geom_polygon(data = study_area_df, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group),
               fill = "white", color = "black") +
  geom_path(data = sjer_roads_df, aes(x = long, y = lat,
                                      group = group, size = factor(RTTYP)), colour = "grey") +
  scale_size_manual("Road Type", values = c("M" = .3,
                                            "S" = .8,
                                            "Unknown" = .3)) +
  geom_point(data = sjer_plots_df, aes(x = coords.x1,
                                       y = coords.x2, shape = factor(plot_type), color = factor(plot_type)), size = 3) +
  scale_color_manual("Plot Type", values = c("trees" = "darkgreen",
                                 "grass" = "darkgreen",
                                 "soil" = "brown")) +
  scale_shape_manual("Plot Type", values = c("grass" = 18,
                                             "soil" = 15,
                                             "trees" = 8)) +
  labs(title = "ggplot map of roads, plots and study area") +
  theme_bw()
```

## Adjust ggplot Theme Settings

Finally, you can use a combination of `cowplot` and `ggplot` `theme()` settings to
remove the x and y axis labels, ticks and lines. You use `background_grid()` to remove the
grey grid from your plot. Then you use the `theme()` function to remove:

* the x and y axis text and ticks.
* the axes lines - `axis.line`.

Let's see how it looks.


```r
# plot ggplot
ggplot() +
  geom_polygon(data = study_area_df, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group),
               fill = "white", color = "black") +
  geom_path(data = sjer_roads_df, aes(x = long, y = lat,
                                      group = group, size = factor(RTTYP)), colour = "grey") +
  scale_size_manual("Road Type", values = c("M" = .3,
                                            "S" = .8,
                                            "Unknown" = .3)) +
  geom_point(data = sjer_plots_df, aes(x = coords.x1,
                                       y = coords.x2, shape = factor(plot_type), color = factor(plot_type)), size = 3) +
  scale_color_manual("Plot Type", values = c("trees" = "darkgreen",
                                 "grass" = "darkgreen",
                                 "soil" = "brown")) +
  scale_shape_manual("Plot Type", values = c("grass" = 18,
                                             "soil" = 15,
                                             "trees" = 8)) +
  labs(title = "ggplot() map of roads, plots and study area",
       x = "", y = "") +
  cowplot::background_grid(major = "none", minor = "none") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(), axis.ticks.x = element_blank(),
        axis.text.y = element_blank(), axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),
        axis.line = element_blank())
```

## Legends and Scale Bars

You can use the `ggsn` package to magically add a legend and a scale bar to your final
map. You can also use this package to create a "blank" map background - removing all
grid background elements. Let's give it a go.

You can add a scale bar using the `scalebar()` function. Note that there is also a
scalebar function in the raster package so you are explicitly telling `R` to use the
function from the `ggsn` package using the syntax

`ggsn::scalebar()`

Also note that there is a bug in the `ggsn` package currently where the documentation
tells us to use `dd2km = FALSE` for data not in geographic lat / long. However,
for this to work, you need to simply omit the argument from function as follows:

For data in UTM meters:
`ggsn::scalebar(data = sjer_roads_df, dist = .5, location = "bottomright")`

For data in geographic lat/long - wgs 84 datum:
`ggsn::scalebar(data = sjer_roads_df, dd2km = TRUE, model = "WGS84", dist = .5, location = "bottomright")`

Below I set the legend location explicitly using the following arguments:

* location: place the scalebar in the bottom right hand corner of the plot
* anchor: this allows me to specify the bottom corner location of my scalebar explicitly
* st.size and st.dist: this allows me to set the size of the text and distance of
the text from the scalebar respectively

`ggsn::scalebar(data = sjer_roads_df, dist = .5, location = "bottomright",
                 st.dist = .05, st.size = 5, height = .06, anchor = c(x = x_scale_loc, y = (y_scale_loc - 360)))`

Finally you can add a north arrow using:

`ggsn::north(sjer_roads_df, scale = .08)`

You can adjust the size and location of the north arrow as well.


```r
# get x and y location for scalebar
roads_ext <- extent(sjer_roads_utmcrop)
x_scale_loc <- roads_ext@xmax
y_scale_loc <- roads_ext@ymin

# plot ggplot
ggplot() +
  geom_polygon(data = study_area_df, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group),
               fill = "white", color = "black") +

                                      group = group, size = factor(RTTYP)), colour = "grey") +

                                            "Unknown" = .3)) +
  geom_point(data = sjer_plots_df, aes(x = coords.x1,
                                       y = coords.x2, shape = factor(plot_type), color = factor(plot_type)), size = 3) +
  scale_color_manual("Plot Type", values = c("trees" = "darkgreen",
                                 "grass" = "darkgreen",

  scale_shape_manual("Plot Type", values = c("grass" = 18,
                                             "soil" = 15,
                                             "trees" = 8)) +

  ggsn::north(sjer_roads_df, scale = .08) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(), axis.ticks.x = element_blank(),
        axis.text.y = element_blank(), axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),
        axis.line = element_blank()) + blank()
