## <i class="fa fa-ship" aria-hidden="true"></i> Welcome to Week {{ page.week }}!

Welcome to week {{ page.week }} of Earth Analytics! This week, you will dive deeper
into working with spatial data in R. You will learn how to handle data in different
coordinate reference systems, how to create custom maps and legends and how to
extract data from a raster file. You are on your way towards integrating many different
types of data into your analysis which involves knowing how to deal with things
like coordinate reference systems and varying data structures.

## <i class="fa fa-check-square-o fa-2" aria-hidden="true"></i> What You Need

You will need a computer with internet access to complete this lesson and the
data for week 4 of the course. Note that the data  download below is large (500MB)
however it contains data that you will use for the next 2 weeks!

### 1. Complete the Assignment Below

<div class="notice--warning" markdown="1">

## <i class="fa fa-pencil-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> Homework (5 points): Due Monday Oct 2 @ 8AM

### Produce a Report

Create a new `R markdown `document. Name it: **lastName-firstInitial-week4.Rmd**
Within your `.Rmd` document, include the plots listed below.

When you are done with your report, use `knitr` to convert it to `.html` format
(note: if you did not get `knitr` working it is ok if you create an html document
and export it to pdf as demonstrated in class). You will submit both the `.Rmd`
file and the `.html` file. Be sure to name your files as instructed above!

In your report, include the plots below. The important part of this week is that
you document each step of your workflow using comments. And that you break up the
sections of your analysis into SEPARATE code chunks.

#### Answer the Questions Below in Your Report
**Write 1 paragraph addressing the following:**

1. In your own words, define what a Coordinate Reference System (`CRS`) is.
1. What are the key components that make up a `CRS`?
1. If you are working with two datasets that are stored using difference `CRS`s,
and want to process or plot them, what do you need to do to ensure that they line
up on a map and can be processed together?
1. In `R`, how do you check to see if two datasets are in the same `CRS`?

#### Plot 1 - Roads Map and Legend

Create a map of California roads:

1. Import the `madera-county-roads/tl_2013_06039_roads.shp` layer located in your `week_04` data download.
2. Create a map that shows the madera roads layer, sjer plot locations and the sjer_aoi boundary (sjer_crop.shp).
3. Plot the roads so different **road types** are represented using unique symbology.
4. Map the plot locations by the attribute **plot type** using unique symbology for each "type".
4. Add a **title** to your plot.
5. Adjust your plot legend.

IMPORTANT: be sure that all of the data are within the same `EXTENT` and `crs`
of the `sjer_aoi` layer. This means that you may have to crop and reproject your
data prior to plotting it!

Be sure that your plot legend is not covering your data. [Use the homework lesson on base plot legends]({{ site.url }}/courses/earth-analytics/spatial-data-r/r-create-custom-legend-with-base-plot/) to help build the legend.
Or use [ggplot]({{ site.url }}/courses/earth-analytics/spatial-data-r/make-maps-with-ggplot-in-R/) to create your plot.


### BONUS 1 (.5 points): Use colorBrewer to Create a Color Ramp
In the lessons, I show you how to color your map by manually selecting colors.
Use the `RColorBrewer` package to create a set of colors to use on your plot.

### BONUS 2 (.5 points): Use mapView or leaflet to create an interactive map with popups.
[This tutorial]({{ site.url }}/courses/earth-analytics/spatial-data-r/make-interactive-maps-with-leaflet-r/) may help you get started.


### Submit to D2L

Submit your report in both `.Rmd` and `.html` format to the D2l week 4 dropbox by 8am. NOTE: it is OK if you'd like to submit an `pdf` document to `D2l` but pdf's won't support interactive maps!

<!-- Question answers -->
<!--
Define CRS

Keys for grading question 1: Part 1
Coordinate system refers to the mathematical calculate that is performed to convert a curved 3 dimensional surface (the earthâ€™s surface) into a flat (2d) surface.
The main components of the CRS are coordinate system, horizontal and vertical units, Datum, and Projection information:

Key Components
Coordinate System: the X, Y grid upon which our data is overlayed and how we define where a point is located in space.
Horizontal and vertical units: The units used to define the grid along the x, y (and z) axis.
Datum: A modeled version of the shape of the earth which defines the origin used to place the coordinate system in space. We will explain this further, below.
Projection Information: the mathematical equation used to flatten objects that are on a round surface (e.g. the earth) so we can view them on a flat surface (e.g. our computer screens or a paper map).
