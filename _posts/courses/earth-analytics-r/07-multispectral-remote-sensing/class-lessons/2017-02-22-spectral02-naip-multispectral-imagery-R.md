## Multispectral Imagery in R

### Introduction to Multi-Band Raster Data

In the previous weeks, you have worked with raster data derived from lidar remote sensing
instruments. These rasters consisted of one layer or band and contained information
height values derived from lidar data. In this lesson, you will
learn how to work with rasters containing multispectral imagery data stored within
multiple bands (or layers) in `R`.

Previously, you used the `raster()` function to open raster data in `R`. To work
with multi-band rasters in `R`, you need to change how you import and plot
your data in several ways.

* To import multi-band raster data you will use the `stack()` function.
* If your multi-band data are imagery that you wish to composite, you can use
`plotRGB()`, instead of `plot()`, to plot a 3 band raster image.

## What is Multispectral Imagery?

One type of multispectral imagery that is familiar to many of us is a color
image. A color image consists of three bands: red, green, and blue. Each
band represents light reflected from the red, green or blue portions of the
electromagnetic spectrum. The pixel brightness for each band, when composited
creates the colors that you see in an image. These colors are the ones your eyes
can see within the visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum.

</figure>

You can plot each band of a multi-band image individually using a grayscale
color gradient. Remember from the videos that you watched in class that the
LIGHTER colors represent a stronger reflection
in that band. DARKER colors represent a weaker reflection.

#### Each Band Plotted Separately

Note there are four bands below. You are looking at the blue, green, red and near
infrared bands of a NAIP image. What do you notice about the relative darkness /
lightness of each image? Is one image brighter than the other?


```r
# use stack function to read in all bands of a color image
rgb_image_3bands <- stack("data/week-07/naip/m_3910505_nw_13_1_20130926/crop/m_3910505_nw_13_1_20130926_crop.tif")
names(rgb_image_3bands) <- c("red_band", "green_band", "blue_band", "near_infrared_band")

plot(rgb_image_3bands,
     col = gray(0:100 / 100),
   box = FALSE, axes = FALSE)
```

<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/courses/earth-analytics-r/07-multispectral-remote-sensing/class-lessons/2017-02-22-spectral02-naip-multispectral-imagery-R/plot-3-bands-1.png" title="All bands plotted separately." alt="All bands plotted separately." width="90%" />

You can plot the red, green and blue bands together to create an RGB image. This
is what you would see with your eyes if you were in the airplane looking down at the Earth.

<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/courses/earth-analytics-r/07-multispectral-remote-sensing/class-lessons/2017-02-22-spectral02-naip-multispectral-imagery-R/plot-rgb-image-1.png" title="Three band RGB image plot." alt="Three band RGB image plot." width="90%" />

## CIR Image

If the image has a 4th Near Infrared (NIR) band, you can create a Color Infrared
(CIR, sometimes called false color) image. In a CIR image, the NIR band is
plotted on the "red" band, the red band is plotted using green and the green band
is plotted using blue. Thus vegetation, which reflects strongly in the NIR part
of the spectrum, is colored "red."

<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/courses/earth-analytics-r/07-multispectral-remote-sensing/class-lessons/2017-02-22-spectral02-naip-multispectral-imagery-R/plot-cir-image-1.png" title="Three band CIR image plot." alt="Three band CIR image plot." width="90%" />



## Other Types of Multi-Band Raster Data

Above you learned about multi-band raster data in the context of multispectral imagery.
However, multi-band raster data might also contain:

1. **Time series data:** the same variable, over the same area, over time.
2. **Multi or hyperspectral imagery:** image rasters that have 4 or more
(multi-spectral) or more than 10-15 (hyperspectral) bands.

## About NAIP Multispectral Imagery

The multispectral imagery that you are using is collected by the National Agricultural Imagery
Program (NAIP).

>The National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) acquires aerial imagery during the agricultural growing seasons in the continental U.S. A primary goal of the NAIP program is to make digital ortho photography available to governmental agencies and the public within a year of acquisition.

> NAIP is administered by the USDA's Farm Service Agency (FSA) through the Aerial Photography Field Office in Salt Lake City. This "leaf-on" imagery is used as a base layer for GIS programs in FSA's County Service Centers, and is used to maintain the Common Land Unit (CLU) boundaries. -- USDA NAIP Program

<a href="https://www.fsa.usda.gov/programs-and-services/aerial-photography/imagery-programs/naip-imagery/" target="_blank">Read more about NAIP</a>

NAIP is a great source of high resolution imagery across the United States.
NAIP imagery is often collected with just a red, green and blue band. However,
some flights include a near infrared band which is very useful for quantifying
vegetation cover and health.

NAIP data access: For this lesson the <a href="https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/" target="_blank">USGS Earth Explorer site was used to download NAIP imagery. </a>


## Open NAIP Multispectral Imagery in R

Next, let's explore some multispectral imagery in `R`. This imagery covers the site
of a fire called the <a href="https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/incident/4848/" target = "_blank">Cold Springs</a>
fire that occurred in Colorado near Nederland. You will learn more about this fire over
the upcoming weeks.

To work with multi-band raster data you use the `raster` and `rgdal`
packages. You'll use the `rgeos` package to crop the data.


```r
# load spatial packages
library(raster)
library(rgdal)
library(rgeos)
```


Next, open up the NAIP imagery for the Cold Springs fire study area in
Colorado.


```r
# Read in multi-band raster with raster function.
# the first band will be read in automatically
# csf = cold springs fire!
naip_csf <- raster("data/week-07/naip/m_3910505_nw_13_1_20130926/crop/m_3910505_nw_13_1_20130926_crop.tif")

# Plot band 1
plot(naip_csf,
     col = gray(0:100 / 100),
     axes = FALSE, box = FALSE,
     main = "NAIP RGB Imagery - Band 1-Red\nCold Springs Fire Scar")
```

<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/courses/earth-analytics-r/07-multispectral-remote-sensing/class-lessons/2017-02-22-spectral02-naip-multispectral-imagery-R/naip-band-1-csf-1.png" title="NAIP imagery single band plot." alt="NAIP imagery single band plot." width="90%" />

```r

# view data dimensions, CRS, resolution, attributes, and band info
naip_csf
## class      : RasterLayer 
## band       : 1  (of  4  bands)
## dimensions : 2312, 4377, 10119624  (nrow, ncol, ncell)
## resolution : 1, 1  (x, y)
## extent     : 457163, 461540, 4424640, 4426952  (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)
## crs        : +proj=utm +zone=13 +ellps=GRS80 +towgs84=0,0,0,0,0,0,0 +units=m +no_defs 
## source     : /root/earth-analytics/data/week-07/naip/m_3910505_nw_13_1_20130926/crop/m_3910505_nw_13_1_20130926_crop.tif 
## names      : m_3910505_nw_13_1_20130926_crop 
## values     : 0, 255  (min, max)
```

Notice that when you look at the attributes of RGB_Band1, you see:

`band: 1  (of  4  bands)`

This is `R` telling us that this particular raster object has more bands
(4 in total). You only imported the first band.

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip:** The number of bands associated with a
raster object can also be determined using the `nbands` slot. Syntax is
`ObjectName@file@nbands`, or specifically for your file: `RGB_band1@file@nbands`.
{: .notice--success}

### Image Raster Data Values
Next, examine the raster min and max values. What is the value range?


```r
# view min value
minValue(naip_csf)
## [1] 0

# view max value
maxValue(naip_csf)
## [1] 255
```

This raster contains values between 0 and 255. These values represent degrees of
brightness associated with the image band. In the case of a RGB image (red, green
and blue), band 1 is the red band. When you plot the red band, larger numbers
(towards 255) represent pixels with more red in them (a strong red reflection).
Smaller numbers (towards 0) represent pixels with less red in them (less red was
reflected). To plot an RGB image, you mix red + green + blue values, using the
ratio of each. The ratio of each color is determined by how much light was recorded
(the reflectance value) in each band. This mixture creates one single color than
in turn makes up the full color image - similar to the color image your camera
phone creates.

### Import a Specific Band
You use the `raster()` function to import specific bands in your raster object
by specifying which band you want with `band=N` (N represents the band number you
want to work with). To import the green band, you would use `band = 2`.


```r
# Can specify which band you want to read in
rgb_band2 <- raster("data/week-07/naip/m_3910505_nw_13_1_20130926/crop/m_3910505_nw_13_1_20130926_crop.tif",
             band = 2)

# plot band 2
plot(rgb_band2,
     col = gray(0:100 / 100),
     axes = FALSE,
     main = "RGB Imagery - Band 2 - Green\nCold Springs Fire Scar")
```

<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/courses/earth-analytics-r/07-multispectral-remote-sensing/class-lessons/2017-02-22-spectral02-naip-multispectral-imagery-R/naip-band-2-plot-1.png" title="NAIP imagery band 2 plot." alt="NAIP imagery band 2 plot." width="90%" />

```r

# view attributes of band 2
rgb_band2
## class      : RasterLayer 
## band       : 2  (of  4  bands)
## dimensions : 2312, 4377, 10119624  (nrow, ncol, ncell)
## resolution : 1, 1  (x, y)
## extent     : 457163, 461540, 4424640, 4426952  (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)
## crs        : +proj=utm +zone=13 +ellps=GRS80 +towgs84=0,0,0,0,0,0,0 +units=m +no_defs 
## source     : /root/earth-analytics/data/week-07/naip/m_3910505_nw_13_1_20130926/crop/m_3910505_nw_13_1_20130926_crop.tif 
## names      : m_3910505_nw_13_1_20130926_crop 
## values     : 0, 255  (min, max)
```

Notice that band 2 is the second of 3 bands `band: 2  (of  4  bands)`.

## Raster Stacks in R

Above you opened and explored just one single band.Next, you will import all four
image bands (red, green, blue and near-infrared) as an `R` `RasterStack` object.
You will then plot a 3-band composite, or full color image.

To bring in all bands of a multi-band raster, use the`stack()` function.
IMPORTANT: All rasters in a raster stack must have the same *extent*,
*CRS* and *resolution*.


```r
# Use stack function to read in all bands
naip_csf_st <-
  stack("data/week-07/naip/m_3910505_nw_13_1_20130926/crop/m_3910505_nw_13_1_20130926_crop.tif")

# view attributes of stack object
naip_csf_st
## class      : RasterStack 
## dimensions : 2312, 4377, 10119624, 4  (nrow, ncol, ncell, nlayers)
## resolution : 1, 1  (x, y)
## extent     : 457163, 461540, 4424640, 4426952  (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)
## crs        : +proj=utm +zone=13 +ellps=GRS80 +towgs84=0,0,0,0,0,0,0 +units=m +no_defs 
## names      : m_3910505_nw_13_1_20130926_crop.1, m_3910505_nw_13_1_20130926_crop.2, m_3910505_nw_13_1_20130926_crop.3, m_3910505_nw_13_1_20130926_crop.4 
## min values :                                 0,                                 0,                                 0,                                 0 
## max values :                               255,                               255,                               255,                               255

inMemory(naip_csf_st)
## [1] FALSE
```

The stack is a good start to working with all the bands. However, if you want to
plot and process the data, a rasterbrick is faster. Next, convert the stack to a brick.

A rasterbrick in `R`, saves all of the bands in the same place making it faster when
you process the data.


```r
# convert data to raster brick
naip_csf_br <- brick(naip_csf_st)
inMemory(naip_csf_br)
## [1] FALSE
```


You can view the attributes of each band the stack using `naip_csf_br@layers`.
Or if you have hundreds of bands, you can specify which band you'd like to view
attributes for using an index value: `naip_csf_br[[1]]`. You can also use the
`plot()` and `hist()` functions on the `RasterStack` to plot and view the
distribution of raster band values.


```r
# view raster attributes
naip_csf_br
## class      : RasterBrick 
## dimensions : 2312, 4377, 10119624, 4  (nrow, ncol, ncell, nlayers)
## resolution : 1, 1  (x, y)
## extent     : 457163, 461540, 4424640, 4426952  (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)

## min values :                                 0,                                 0,                                 0,                                 0 
## max values :                               255,                               255,                               255,                               255
```

View attributes of one band.


```r
# view attributes for one band
naip_csf_br[[1]]
## class      : RasterLayer 
## band       : 1  (of  4  bands)
## dimensions : 2312, 4377, 10119624  (nrow, ncol, ncell)
## resolution : 1, 1  (x, y)

## values     : 0, 255  (min, max)
```

You can view a histogram of each band in your stack. This is useful to better
understand the distribution of reflectance values for each band.


```r
# view histogram for each band
hist(naip_csf_br,
     maxpixels = ncell(naip_csf_br),
     col = "purple")
```

<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/courses/earth-analytics-r/07-multispectral-remote-sensing/class-lessons/2017-02-22-spectral02-naip-multispectral-imagery-R/naip-hist-all-layers-1.png" title="Histogram of each NAIP band for a total of 4 bands." alt="Histogram of each NAIP band for a total of 4 bands." width="90%" />

Plot each band individually.


```r
# plot 4 bands separately
plot(naip_csf_br,
     col = gray(0:100 / 100))
```

<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/courses/earth-analytics-r/07-multispectral-remote-sensing/class-lessons/2017-02-22-spectral02-naip-multispectral-imagery-R/naip-plot-all-layers-1.png" title="Plot each NAIP band for a total of 4 bands." alt="Plot each NAIP band for a total of 4 bands." width="90%" />

You can plot just one band too.


```r
# plot band 2
plot(naip_csf_br[[2]],
     main = "NAIP Band 2\n Coldsprings Fire Site",
     col = gray(0:100 / 100))
```

## <i class="fa fa-pencil-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> Optional Challenge: Making Sense of Single Band Images

</div>



## RGB Data

Previously you've explored the single bands in your `rasterstack`. Next, you'll plot an RGB image.

### Use `plotRGB()` to Create a Composite 3 Band Image
To render a 3 band, color image in `R`, you use `plotRGB()`.

This function allows us to:

1. Identify what bands you want to render in the red, green and blue regions. The
`plotRGB()` function defaults to a 1 = red, 2 = green, and 3 = blue band order.
However, you can define what bands you'd like to plot manually. Manual definition of
bands is useful if you have, for example a near-infrared band and want to create
a color infrared image.
2. Adjust the `stretch` of the image to increase or decrease contrast.

Let's plot your 3-band image.




```r
# Create an RGB image from the raster stack
plotRGB(naip_csf_br,
        r = 1, g = 2, b = 3,
        main = "RGB image \nColdsprings fire scar")
```

<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/courses/earth-analytics-r/07-multispectral-remote-sensing/class-lessons/2017-02-22-spectral02-naip-multispectral-imagery-R/naip-plot-rgb-image-csf-1.png" title="RGB image of NAIP imagery." alt="RGB image of NAIP imagery." width="90%" />

To add a title to your plot, adjust the parameters as follows:

* `col.axis = "white"`: set the axes to render in white. if you turn off the axes then the plot title will also be turned off.
* `col.lab = "white"`: turn plot tick mark labels to white.
* `tck = 0`: turn off plot "ticks."

Finally after the plot code if you set `box(col = "white")` it removes the line
that is drawn alongside of your plot.


```r
# adjust the plot parameters to render the axes using white
# this is a way to "trick" R
par(col.axis = "white", col.lab = "white", tck = 0)
plotRGB(naip_csf_br,
        r = 1, g = 2, b = 3,
        axes = TRUE,
        main = "NAIP RGB image \nColdsprings fire scar")
box(col = "white") # turn all of the lines to white
```

## Apply a Stretch to Normalize the Colors in the Image

The image above looks pretty good. You can explore whether applying a stretch to
the image might improve clarity and contrast using `stretch="lin"` or

        axes = TRUE,

What does the image look like using a different stretch? Any better? Worse?


```r
par(col.axis = "white", col.lab = "white", tck = 0)
plotRGB(naip_csf_br,
        r = 1, g = 2, b = 3,
        axes = TRUE,
        scale = 800,
        stretch = "hist",
        main = "NAIP RGB plot with hist stretch\nColdsprings fire scar")
box(col = "white") # turn all of the lines to white
```

<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/courses/earth-analytics-r/07-multispectral-remote-sensing/class-lessons/2017-02-22-spectral02-naip-multispectral-imagery-R/plot-rgb-hist-stretch-1.png" title="RGB with histogram stretch applied." alt="RGB with histogram stretch applied." width="90%" />

In this case, the stretch doesn't enhance the contrast of your image significantly
given the distribution of reflectance (or brightness) values is distributed well
between 0 and 255. You are lucky! Your NAIP imagery has been processed well and
thus you don't need to worry about image stretch.


## More on RasterStacks vs RasterBricks in R

The `R` `RasterStack` and `RasterBrick` object types can both store multiple bands.
However, how they store each band is different. The bands in a `RasterStack` are
stored as links to raster data that is located somewhere on your computer. A
`RasterBrick` contains all of the objects stored within the actual `R` object.
In most cases, you can work with a `RasterBrick` in the same way you might work
with a `RasterStack`. However a `RasterBrick` is often more efficient and faster
to process - which is important when working with larger files.

* <a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/raster/versions/2.5-8/topics/brick" target="_blank">
More on Raster Bricks</a>

You can turn a `RasterStack` into a `RasterBrick` in `R` by using
`brick(StackName)`. Let's use the `object.size()` function to compare `stack`
and `brick` `R` objects.


```r
# view size of the RGB_stack object that contains your 3 band image
object.size(naip_csf_st)
## 56888 bytes

# convert stack to a brick
naip_brick_csf <- brick(naip_csf_st)

# view size of the brick
object.size(naip_brick_csf)
## 161927968 bytes
```

Notice that in the `RasterBrick`, all of the bands are stored within the actual
object. Thus, the `RasterBrick` object size is much larger than the
`RasterStack` object.

You use `plotRGB` to block a `RasterBrick` too.


```r
par(col.axis = "white", col.lab = "white", tck = 0)
# plot brick
plotRGB(naip_brick_csf,
  main = "NAIP plot from a rasterbrick",
  axes = TRUE)
box(col = "white") # turn all of the lines to white
```

## <i class="fa fa-pencil-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> Optional Challenge
The NAIP image that you've been working with so far is pre-fire.
Import the `naip/m_3910505_nw_13_1_20150919/crop/m_3910505_nw_13_1_20150919_crop.tif`
into R and plot a:

1. RGB image.
2. CIR image.

Then answer the following questions:

* How many bands does the raster have?
* What CRS is the raster in?
* What is the resolution of the data?
