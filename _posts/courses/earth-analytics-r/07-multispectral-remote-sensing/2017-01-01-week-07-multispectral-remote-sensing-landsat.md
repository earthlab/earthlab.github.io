### 2. Complete the Assignment Below (5 points)

<div class="notice--warning" markdown="1">

## <i class="fa fa-pencil-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> Homework Submission

### Produce a Report

Create a new `R markdown `document. Name it: **lastName-firstInitial-weeknumber.Rmd**
Within your `.Rmd` document, include the plots listed below. When you are done
with your report, use `knitr` to convert it to `html` or `pdf` format. Submit both the
`.Rmd` file and the `.html or pdf` file. Be sure to name your files as instructed above!

#### Use knitr Code Chunk Arguments
In your final report, use the following `knitr` code chunk arguments to hide messages
and warnings and code as you see fit.

* `message = FALSE`, `warning = FALSE` Hide warnings and messages in a code chunk
* `echo = FALSE` Hide code and just show code output
* `results = 'hide'` Hide the verbose output from some functions like `readOGR()`

#### Answer the Questions Below at the Top of Your Report

1. What is the key difference between active and passive remote sensing system?
  * Provide one example of data derived from an active sensor that you have worked with in this class and one example of data derived from a passive sensor in your answer.
2. Compare Lidar vs. Landsat remote sensing data and answer the following questions:
  * What does Landsat vs Lidar data inherently measure  / record?
  * What is the spatial resolution of Landsat compared to the Lidar data that you used in class?
  * How often is Landsat data collected over a particular area? Are Lidar data collected at the same frequency as Landsat?
2. Explain what a vegetation index is and how it's used. HINT: NDVI is an example of a vegetation index however there are other indices too. Define vegetation index not just NDVI.
3. After you've created the plots - do you notice anything about the Landsat data that may be problematic if you needed to compare NDVI before and after a fire?

Then create the plots and output data sets below.

#### Include the Plots and Outputs Below

For all plots:

1. Be sure to describe what each plot shows in your final report using a figure
caption argument in your code chunks: `fig.cap="caption here"`.
2. Add appropriate titles that tell someone reading your report what the map shows.
3. Be sure to use the correct bands as you plot and process the data.
4. Apply image stretch as you see fit.
5. Be sure to specify the DATE that the imagery was collected in your plot title (note I did not do that in the examples below as you need to figure it out).

#### Plots 1 & 2: RGB & CIR Images Using NAIP Data
Create a 1) RGB and 2) Color Infrared (CIR) image of the study site using NAIP data: `naip/m_3910505_nw_13_1_20150919/crop/m_3910505_nw_13_1_20150919_crop.tif`

HINT: In a CIR image the:

* Infrared band will appear red.
* Red band will appear green.
* Green band will appear blue.

Make sure you get the bands right!

#### Plot 3: Create a Plot of NDVI + Output Geotiff Using NAIP Data

Using the same NAIP image above, calculate NDVI and plot it. **IMPORTANT:** Use a function to
perform the NDVI math and the `overlay()` function to implement the
actual NDVI calculation. Your code should look something like this: `overlay(b1, b2, fun = normalized_diff)`. Be sure that your function is included in your code when you submit your assignment!

* Use the `writeRaster()` function to output your NAIP_ndvi file as a geotiff.
* Use the `check_create_dir()` function that you created last week to ensure that file goes into an "outputs/naip" directory.

#### Plots 4 & 5: NDVI Plots + Output Geotiff Using Landsat Data

Create map of NDVI pre and post Cold Springs fire using the Landsat data provided
in the week_07 data set. As you did with the NAIP imagery
above, be sure to use the `overlay()` function with the `normalized_diff()` function
that you created.

* Use the `writeRaster()` function to output your landsat_ndvi files (one for pre fire and one for post) as a geotiff.
* Use the `check_create_dir()` function that you created last week to ensure that the file goes into an "outputs/landsat" directory.

IMPORTANT: don't forget to label each map appropriately with the date that the
data were collected and pre or post fire!

#### Plot 6 & 7: RGB & CIR Images Using Landsat Data

Plot a RGB and CIR image using Landsat data collected pre-fire.


HINTS:

If you see the error below when you plot your RGB images, try to apply a
stretch argument to your `plotRGB()` function.

```r
## Error in grDevices::rgb(RGB[, 1], RGB[, 2], RGB[, 3], alpha = alpha, max = scale) :
##  color intensity -0.00010005, not in [0,1]
```

Try to add the code chunk below after any plots where you change the columns
using the `par()` function. This will "clean" your plot parameters so the next
plot renders correctly.


```html
{r, echo = FALSE, results = 'hide'}
# the function below clears your plot render space removing any margins or
# other changes to `par()` settings.
dev.off()

```

### IMPORTANT: For All Plots

* Add a title to your plot that describes what the plot shows.
* Add a brief, 1-3 sentence caption below each plot that describes what it shows HINT: you can use the `knitr` argument `fig.cap = "Caption here"` to automatically add captions.
* Be sure to mention the data source and the date that the data were collected.

## Bonus Opportunity! (.5 point each)

* Rather than copying your function code at the top of your `.Rmd` file, use the
`source()` function to import all of the functions that you created and need for your homework. These functions include `normalized_diff()` and `check_create_dir()`.
* Look at your code and notice where there are repeated tasks (focus on importing and calculating NDVI using Landsat data). Write a well-documented function that takes a directory path containing Landsat geotiffs as the input and outputs either a `rasterbrick` that you can use to calculate NDVI OR the NDVI raster itself. Think carefully about making your function as general as possible. Name your function using an expressive name (a verb in the name is preferred).

#### Plot 2
Create a MAP of the **difference between NBR pre vs post fire** with Landsat data  (Pre fire - post-fire NBR). Classify that data using the classification thresholds below. Be sure to include a legend on your map that helps someone looking at it
understand differences.

| SEVERITY LEVEL  | NBR RANGE |
|------------------------------|
| Enhanced Regrowth | -700 to  -100  |
| Unburned       |  -100 to +100  |
| Low Severity     | +100 to +270  |
| Moderate Severity  | +270 to +660  |
| High Severity     |  +660 to +1300 |

Note: if your min and max NBR values are outside of the range above, you can adjust
-700 to be your smallest raster value and for high severity you can adjust 1300 to
be your largest NBR raster value.

#### Plot 3
Create a classified map of **post fire NDVI** with Landsat data using classification values that you
think make sense based upon exploring the data.

#### Plot 4
Create a map of **post fire NBR** with Landsat data.
