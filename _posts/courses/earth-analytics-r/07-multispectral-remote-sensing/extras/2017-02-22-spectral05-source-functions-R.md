## <i class="fa fa-graduation-cap" aria-hidden="true"></i> Learning Objectives

After completing this tutorial, you will be able to:

* Calculate NDVI using NAIP multispectral imagery in `R`.
* Describe what a vegetation index is and how it is used with spectral remote sensing data.

You will need a computer with internet access and `R` / `R Studio` loaded to
complete this lesson.

## Where to Store Your Functions

When you create a function to use in your analysis, you often create it and
store it at the top of your script or `.Rmd` file as a first step. However,
lots of functions at the top of your code can make your code dense and harder
to read.

It is good practice to create separate `R` scripts that you can use to
store sets of related functions. You can then call those functions using the
`source()` function, at the top of your script in the same way that you call an
`R` package. `R` will then load those functions into memory and you can use them!

Sourcing functions is good practice because it is:

1. **Reusable:** It allows you to reuse functions over and over using the same code (i.e. you don't have to copy and paste the function into each new analysis script).
2. **Easy to Maintain:** It allows you to quickly fix a function that doesn't work properly - only once.
3. **Sharable:** In the same way that a library can be used by anyone, you can share your `R` script containing your functions with anyone, too. This is the first step towards creating an `R` package!


## How to Source Functions in R

To source a set of functions in `R`:

1. Create a new `R Script` (.R file) in the same working directory as your `.Rmd` file or `R` script. Give the file a descriptive name that captures the types of functions in the file.
2. Open that `R Script` file and add one or more functions to the file.
3. Save your file.

Next,

* Open your `.Rmd` file or `R` script.
* At the top of your file, add the `source(path/tofile/here.R)` function.

`source("remote-sensing-functions.R")`

If the `.R` script is in your main working directory, then it won't have a path
element before it like `week_06/functionfile.R` vs `functionfile.R`.

If it's in a different directory, adjust the path accordingly.
Once you run the code containing the `source()` function, all of the functions in
your `.R` file will load into your global environment. You can now use them in your
script!
