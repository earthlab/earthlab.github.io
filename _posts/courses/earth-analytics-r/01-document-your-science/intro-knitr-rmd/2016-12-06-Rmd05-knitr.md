In the previous tutorials we've learned about the `R Markdown` format and how
to create a report using `R Markdown` in `RStudio`. In this tutorial, we will
render or `knit` an `R Markdown` document to a web friendly, `html` format using
the `R` `knitr` package. `knitr` can be used to convert `R Markdown` files to many
different formats including: `html`, `pdf`, GitHub markdown (`.md`) and more.

<div class='notice--success' markdown="1">

## <i class="fa fa-graduation-cap" aria-hidden="true"></i> Learning Objectives

At the end of this lesson, you will:

* Be able to produce (`knit`) an `html` file from an `R Markdown` file.
* Know how to modify chuck options to change what is rendered and not rendered on the output `html` file.

## <i class="fa fa-check-square-o fa-2" aria-hidden="true"></i> What You Need

You will need the most current version of `R` and, preferably, `RStudio` loaded on
your computer to complete this tutorial. You will also need an `R Markdown`
document that contains a `YAML` header, code chunks and markdown segments.

### Install R Packages

* **knitr:** `install.packages("knitr")`
* **rmarkdown:** `install.packages("rmarkdown")`

## What is Knitr?

`knitr` is the `R` package that we use to convert an `R Markdown` document into another,
more user friendly format like `.html` or `.pdf`.

The `knitr` package allows us to:

* Publish & share preliminary results with collaborators.
* Create professional reports that document our workflow and results directly
from our code, reducing the risk of accidental copy and paste or transcription errors.
* Document our workflow to facilitate reproducibility.
* Efficiently change code outputs (figures, files) given changes in the data, methods, etc.

>The `knitr` package was designed to be a transparent engine for dynamic report
generation with `R` --

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **When To Knit**: Knitting is a useful exercise
throughout your scientific workflow. It allows you to see what your outputs
look like and also to test that your code runs without errors.
The time required to knit depends on the length and complexity of the script
and the size of your data.

### How to Knit

</figure>

To knit in `RStudio`, click the **Knit** pull down button. You want to use the
**Knit HTML** option for this lesson.

When you click the **Knit HTML** button, a  window will open in your console
titled R Markdown. This
pane shows the knitting progress. The output (`html` in this case) file will
automatically be saved in the current working directory. If there is an error
in the code, an error message will appear with a line number in the R Console
to help you diagnose the problem.

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data tip:** You can run `knitr` from the command prompt
using: `render(“input.Rmd”, “all”)`.

When knitting is complete, the `html` file produced will automatically open.

Notice that information from the `YAML` header (title, author, date) is printed
at the top of the HTML document. Then the `html` shows the text, code, and
results of the code that you included in the `Rmd` document.

<div class="notice--warning" markdown="1">

## <i class="fa fa-pencil-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> Challenge Activity

Add the code below to your `.Rmd` document. Then `knit` to `.html` format.

</div>


```r

# load the ggplot2 library for plotting
library(ggplot2)

# download data from figshare
# note that we are downloading  the data into your working directory (earth-analytics)
download.file(url = "https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/7010681",
              destfile = "data/boulder-precip.csv")

# import data
boulder_precip <- read.csv(file="data/boulder-precip.csv")

# view first few rows of the data
head(boulder_precip)

# when we download the data we create a dataframe
# view each column of the data frame using it's name (or header)
boulder_precip$DATE

# view the precip column
boulder_precip$PRECIP

# q plot stands for quick plot. Let's use it to plot our data
qplot(x=boulder_precip$DATE,
      y=boulder_precip$PRECIP)

```

When you `knit` your `.Rmd` file to `pdf`, the plot you produce should look like
the one below. Not so pretty, eh? Don't worry - we will learn more about plotting
in a later tutorial!

#### Where is the File?

In the steps above, we downloaded a file. However, where did that file go on your
computer? Let's find it before we go any further.

```r

# what is the working directory?
getwd()

[1] "/Users/lewa8222/Documents/earth-analytics"

# set working dir as a variable
my.dir <- getwd()

# what files are in that working directory?
list.files(my.dir, recursive= TRUE)
```
Is the `boulder-precip.csv` file there?
