## About vegetation indices



A vegetation index is a single value that quantifies vegetation health or structure.
The math associated with calculating a vegetation index is derived from the physics
of light reflection and absorption across bands. For instance, it is known that
healthy vegetation reflects light strongly in the near infrared band and less strongly
in the visible portion of the spectrum. Thus, if you create a ratio between light
reflected in the near infrared and light reflected in the visible spectrum, it
will represent areas that potentially have healthy vegetation.


## Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)
The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is a quantitative index of
greenness ranging from 0-1 where 0 represents minimal or no greenness and 1
represents maximum greenness.

NDVI is often used for a quantitate proxy measure of vegetation health, cover
and phenology (life cycle stage) over large areas. Our NDVI data is a Landsat
derived single band product saved as a GeoTIFF for different times of the year.

    <figcaption>NDVI is calculated from the visible and near-infrared light
    reflected by vegetation. Healthy vegetation (left) absorbs most of the
    visible light that hits it, and reflects a large portion of
    near-infrared light. Unhealthy or sparse vegetation (right) reflects more
    visible light and less near-infrared light. Source: NASA

## Calculate NDVI

Sometimes we are able to download already calculated NDVI data products. In this
case, we need to calculate NDVI ourselves using the reflectance data that we have.

```{r load-packages, warning=F, message=F, results="hide"}
# load spatial packages
library(raster)
library(rgdal)
library(rgeos)
# turn off factors
options(stringsAsFactors = F)
```


```{r create-landsat-stack }
all_landsat_bands <- list.files("data/week6/Landsat/LC80340322016205-SC20170127160728/crop",
           pattern=glob2rx("*band*.tif$"),
           full.names = T) # use the dollar sign at the end to get all files that END WITH
all_landsat_bands

# stack the data
landsat_stack_csf <- stack(all_landsat_bands)
```


## Calculate NDVI
(NIR - Red) / (NIR + Red)

```{r calculate-ndvi, fig.cap="landsat derived NDVI plot"}

landsat_ndvi <- (landsat_stack_csf[[5]] - landsat_stack_csf[[4]]) / (landsat_stack_csf[[5]] + landsat_stack_csf[[4]])

plot(landsat_ndvi,
     main="Landsat derived NDVI\n 23 July 2016")
```

### View distribution of NDVI values

```{r ndvi-hist, fig.cap="histogram"}
# view distribution of NDVI values
hist(landsat_ndvi)

```

## Calculate NBR

figure:
nbr_index.png


This index highlights burned areas in large fire zones greater than 500 acres. The formula is similar to a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), except that it uses near-infrared (NIR) and shortwave-infrared (SWIR) wavelengths (Lopez, 1991; Key and Benson, 1995).


The NBR was originally developed for use with Landsat TM and ETM+ bands 4 and 7, but it will work with any multispectral sensor (including Landsat 8) with a NIR band between 0.76-0.9 µm and a SWIR band between 2.08-2.35
µm.

Look at the table. what bands do you need to calculate Nbr?

```{r calculate-nbr, echo=F, fig.cap="landsat derived NDVI plot"}
# bands 7 and 5
landsat_nbr <- (landsat_stack_csf[[5]] - landsat_stack_csf[[7]]) / (landsat_stack_csf[[5]] + landsat_stack_csf[[7]])

plot(landsat_nbr,
     main="Landsat derived NBR\n 23 July 2016",
     axes=F,
     box=F)
```
