## About Raster Bands in R

In the previous weeks, we've worked with rasters derived from lidar remote sensing
instruments. These rasters consisted of one layer or band and contained information
related to height derived from lidar data. In this lesson, we'll
learn how to work with rasters containing spectral (image) data stored within
multiple bands (or layers) in `R`.

Previously, we used the `raster()` function to open raster data in `R`. To work
with multi-band rasters in `R`, we need to change how we import and plot
our data in several ways.

* To import multi band raster data we will use the `stack()` function.
* If our multi-band data are imagery that we wish to composite, we can use
`plotRGB()`, instead of `plot()`, to plot a 3 band raster image.

## About Multi-Band Imagery
One type of multi-band raster data that is familiar to many of us is a color
image. A color image consists of three bands: red, green, and blue. Each
band represents light reflected from the red, green or blue portions of the
electromagnetic spectrum. The pixel brightness for each band, when composited
creates the colors that we see in an image. These colors are the ones our eyes
can see within the visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum.

We can plot each band of a multi-band image individually using a grayscale
color gradient. Remember from the videos that we watched in class that the
LIGHTER colors represent a stronger reflection
in that band. DARKER colors represent a weaker reflection.

```{r crop-naip-imagey, echo=F, results='hide', message=F, warning=F}
library(raster)
library(rgeos)
library(rgdal)
# import stack
rgb_image_3bands <- stack("data/week6/naip/m_3910505_nw_13_1_20130926/crop/m_3910505_nw_13_1_20130926_crop.tif")
# import vector that we used to crop the data
# csf_crop <- readOGR("data/week6/vector_layers/fire_crop_box_500m.shp")

```



```{r demonstrate-RGB-Image, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="single band image"}
# plot 1 band
rgb_image <- raster("data/week6/naip/m_3910505_nw_13_1_20130926/crop/m_3910505_nw_13_1_20130926_crop.tif")
# does this look like a color image?
plot(rgb_image,
     main="Plot of one band in a multi-band raster",
     col=gray(0:100 / 100))
```

#### Each band plotted separately

Note there are four bands below. You are looking at the blue, green, red and Near
infrared bands of a NAIP image. What do you notice about the relative darkness /
lightness of each image? Is one image brighter than the other?

```{r plot-3-bands, echo=F, fig.cap="All bands plotted separately"}
# use stack function to read in all bands of a color image
rgb_image_3bands <- stack("data/week6/naip/m_3910505_nw_13_1_20130926/crop/m_3910505_nw_13_1_20130926_crop.tif")
names(rgb_image_3bands) <- c("red_band", "green_band", "blue_band", "near_infrared_band")

plot(rgb_image_3bands,
     col=gray(0:100 / 100))

```

We can plot the red, green and blue bands together to create an RGB image. This is
what we would see with our eyes if we were in the airplane looking down at the earth.

```{r plot-rgb-example, echo=F, fig.cap="3 band image plot rgb"}
# Create an RGB image from the raster stack
par(col.axis="white", col.lab="white", tck=0)
plotRGB(rgb_image_3bands,
        stretch="lin",
        axes=TRUE,
        main="Red, green, blue composite image")
box(col="white") # turn all of the lines to white
```

## CIR image

If the image has a 4th NIR band, you can create a CIR (sometimes called false color)
image. In a color infrared image, the NIR band is plotted on the "red" band. Thus vegetation, which
reflects stronly in the NIR part of the spectrum, is colored "red".

```{r cir-image, echo=F, fig.cap="3 band cir image"}
# Create an RGB image from the raster stack
par(col.axis="white",col.lab="white",tck=0)
# CIR image
plotRGB(rgb_image_3bands,
        r=4,g=3,b=2,
        main="Color infrared image\n Near infrared, green, blue",
        axes=T)
box(col="white") # turn all of the lines to white

```
```{r, echo=F, warning=F, message=F, results="hide" }
dev.off()
```

## Other Types of Multi-band Raster Data

Multi-band raster data might also contain:

1. **Time series:** the same variable, over the same area, over time.
2. **Multi or hyperspectral imagery:** image rasters that have 4 or more
(multi-spectral) or more than 10-15 (hyperspectral) bands.

We will work with time series data later in the semester.

## Work with Landsat data in R

Now, we have learned that basic concepts associated with a multi-band raster. Next,
let's explore some spectral imagery in `R` to better understand our study site -
which is the cold springs fire scare in Colorado near Nederland.

To work with multi-band raster data we will use the `raster` and `rgdal`
packages.

```{r load-packages, warning=F, message=F, results="hide"}
# load spatial packages
library(raster)
library(rgdal)
library(rgeos)

```

In this lesson we will use imagery from the National Agricultural Imagery
Program (NAIP).

### About NAIP:

>The National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) acquires aerial imagery during the agricultural growing seasons in the continental U.S. A primary goal of the NAIP program is to make digital ortho photography available to governmental agencies and the public within a year of acquisition.

> NAIP is administered by the USDA's Farm Service Agency (FSA) through the Aerial Photography Field Office in Salt Lake City. This "leaf-on" imagery is used as a base layer for GIS programs in FSA's County Service Centers, and is used to maintain the Common Land Unit (CLU) boundaries. -- USDA NAIP Program

<a href="<a href="https://www.fsa.usda.gov/programs-and-services/aerial-photography/imagery-programs/naip-imagery/" target="_blank">Read more about NAIP</a>

NAIP is a great source of high resolution imagery across the United States.
NAIP imagery is often collected with just a red, green and Blue band. However,
some flights include a near infrared band which is very useful for quantifying
vegetation cover and health.

NAIP data access: For this lesson we used the <a href="<a href="https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/" target="_blank">USGS Earth explorer site to
download NAIP imagery. </a>

Next, let's open up our NAIP imagery for the Coldsprings fire study area in
Colorado.

```{r read-single-band, fig.cap="naip imagery single band plot.",  }
# Read in multi-band raster with raster function.
# the first band will be read in automatically
# csf = cold springs fire!
naip_csf <- raster("data/week6/naip/m_3910505_nw_13_1_20130926/crop/m_3910505_nw_13_1_20130926_crop.tif")

# Plot band 1
plot(naip_csf,
     col=gray(0:100 / 100),
     axes=FALSE,
     main="NAIP RGB Imagery - Band 1-Red\nCold Springs Fire Scar")

# view data dimensions, CRS, resolution, attributes, and band info
naip_csf
```

Notice that when we look at the attributes of RGB_Band1, we see:

`band: 1  (of  4  bands)`

This is `R` telling us that this particular raster object has more bands
(4 in total). We only imported the first band.

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip:** The number of bands associated with a
raster object can also be determined using the `nbands` slot. Syntax is
`ObjectName@file@nbands`, or specifically for our file: `RGB_band1@file@nbands`.
{: .notice}

### Image Raster Data Values
Let's next examine the raster's min and max values. What is the value range?

```{r min-max-image }
# view min value
minValue(naip_csf)

# view max value
maxValue(naip_csf)
```

This raster contains values between 0 and 255. These values
represent degrees of brightness associated with the image band. In
the case of a RGB image (red, green and blue), band 1 is the red band. When
we plot the red band, larger numbers (towards 255) represent pixels with more
red in them (a strong red reflection). Smaller numbers (towards 0) represent
pixels with less red in them (less red was reflected). To
plot an RGB image, we mix red + green + blue values, using the ratio of each. The
ratio of each color is determined by how much light was recorded (the reflectance value)
in each band. This mixture creates one single color than inturn makes up the
full color image - similar to the color image your camera phone creates.

### Import A Specific Band
We can use the `raster()` function to import specific bands in our raster object
by specifying which band we want with `band=N` (N represents the band number we
want to work with). To import the green band, we would use `band=2`.

```{r read-specific-band, fig.cap="naip imagery band 2 plot."}
# Can specify which band we want to read in
rgb_band2 <- raster("data/week6/naip/m_3910505_nw_13_1_20130926/crop/m_3910505_nw_13_1_20130926_crop.tif",
             band = 2)

# plot band 2
plot(rgb_band2,
     col=gray(0:100 / 100),
     axes=FALSE,
     main="RGB Imagery - Band 2 - Green\nCold Springs Fire Scar")

# view attributes of band 2
rgb_band2
```

Notice that band 2 is the second of 3 bands `band: 2  (of  4  bands)`.

## Raster Stacks in R
Next, we will work with all four image bands (red, green, blue and near-infrared) as an `R`
`RasterStack` object. We will then plot a 3-band composite, or full color
image.

To bring in all bands of a multi-band raster, we use the`stack()` function.
IMPORTANT: All rasters in a raster stack must have the same *extent*,
*CRS* and *resolution*.

```{r intro-to-raster-stacks }
# Use stack function to read in all bands
naip_stack_csf <-
  stack("data/week6/naip/m_3910505_nw_13_1_20130926/crop/m_3910505_nw_13_1_20130926_crop.tif")

# view attributes of stack object
naip_stack_csf

```

We can view the attributes of each band the stack using `naip_stack_csf@layers`.
Or we if we have hundreds of bands, we can specify which band we'd like to view
attributes for using an index value: `naip_stack_csf[[1]]`. We can also use the
`plot()` and `hist()` functions on the `RasterStack` to plot and view the
distribution of raster band values.

```{r view-layers}
# view raster attributes
naip_stack_csf@layers
```

View attributes of one band.

```{r view-one-band}
# view attributes for one band
naip_stack_csf[[1]]
```

We can view a histogram of each band in our stack. This is useful to better understand
the distribution of reflectance values for each band.

```{r hist-all-layers, fig.cap="histogram of each band for a total of 4 bands"}
# view histogram for each band
hist(naip_stack_csf,
     maxpixels=ncell(naip_stack_csf),
     col="purple")
```

Plot each band individually.

```{r plot-all-layers, fig.cap="plot each band for a total of 4 bands"}
# plot 4 bands separately
plot(naip_stack_csf,
     col=gray(0:100 / 100))
```

We can plot just one band too if we want.

```{r plot-individual-bands, fig.cap="plot individual band - band 2" }
# plot band 2
plot(naip_stack_csf[[2]],
     main="NAIP Band 2\n Coldsprings Fire Site",
     col=gray(0:100 / 100))
```

darker or lighter in band 2 (the green band) compared to band 1 (the red band)?
</div>

```{r challenge1-answer, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE }

# band 1 (red) because the leaves on trees of most often appear "green" -

```

## RGB Data

Previously we've explored the single bands in our rasterstack. Next, we'll plot an RGB image.

### Use plotRGB() to create a composite 3 band image
To render a 3 band, color image in `R`, we use `plotRGB()`.

This function allows us to:

1. Identify what bands we want to render in the red, green and blue regions. The
`plotRGB()` function defaults to a 1=red, 2=green, and 3=blue band order. However,
you can define what bands you'd like to plot manually. Manual definition of
bands is useful if you have, for example a near-infrared band and want to create
a color infrared image.
2. Adjust the `stretch` of the image to increase or decrease contrast.

Let's plot our 3-band image.

```{r clear-dev, echo=F, warning=F, message=F, results='hide'}
dev.off()
```

```{r plot-rgb-image, fig.cap="RGB image of NAIP imagery." }
# Create an RGB image from the raster stack
plotRGB(naip_stack_csf,
        r = 1, g = 2, b = 3,
        main="RGB image \nColdsprings fire scar")
```
Here's how we add a title to our plot. To do this, we adjust the
**par**ameters of the plot as follows:

* `col.axis="white"`: set the axes to render in white. if you turn off the axes then the plot title will also be turned off.
* `col.lab="white"`: turn plot tick mark labels to white
* `tck=0`: turn off plot "ticks"

Finally after the plot code if you set `box(col="white")` it removes the line
that is drawn alongside of your plot.

```{r plot-rgb-image-title, fig.cap="RGB image of NAIP imagery." }
# adjust the plot parameters to render the axes using white
# this is a way to "trick" R
par(col.axis="white", col.lab="white", tck=0)
plotRGB(naip_stack_csf,
        r = 1, g = 2, b = 3,
        axes=T,
        main="NAIP RGB image \nColdsprings fire scar")
box(col="white") # turn all of the lines to white

```

The image above looks pretty good. We can explore whether applying a stretch to
the image might improve clarity and contrast using `stretch="lin"` or
`stretch="hist"`.

</figure>

```{r image-stretch, fig.cap="lin stretch rgb image"}
# what does stretch do?
plotRGB(naip_stack_csf,
        r = 1, g = 2, b = 3,
        axes=T,
        stretch = "lin",
        main="NAIP RGB plot with linear stretch\nColdsprings fire scar")
```

What does the image look like using a different stretch? Any better? worse?

```{r plot-rgb-hist-stretch, fig.cap="plot RGB with his stretch"}
par(col.axis="white", col.lab="white", tck=0)
plotRGB(naip_stack_csf,
        r = 1, g = 2, b = 3,
        axes=T,
        scale=800,
        stretch = "hist",
        main="NAIP RGB plot with hist stretch\nColdsprings fire scar")
box(col="white") # turn all of the lines to white

```

In this case, the stretch doesn't enhance the contrast our image significantly
given the distribution of reflectance (or brightness) values is distributed well
between 0 and 255. We are lucky! Our NAIP imagery has been processed well and
thus we don't need to worry about image stretch.


## RasterStack vs RasterBrick in R

The `R` `RasterStack` and `RasterBrick` object types can both store multiple bands.
However, how they store each band is different. The bands in a `RasterStack` are
stored as links to raster data that is located somewhere on our computer. A
`RasterBrick` contains all of the objects stored within the actual `R` object.
In most cases, we can work with a `RasterBrick` in the same way we might work
with a `RasterStack`. However a `RasterBrick` is often more efficient and faster
to process - which is important when working with larger files.

* <a href="http://www.inside-r.org/packages/cran/raster/docs/brick" target="_blank">
More on Raster Bricks</a>

We can turn a `RasterStack` into a `RasterBrick` in `R` by using
`brick(StackName)`. Let's use the `object.size()` function to compare `stack`
and `brick` `R` objects.

```{r raster-bricks }
# view size of the RGB_stack object that contains our 3 band image
object.size(naip_stack_csf)

# convert stack to a brick
naip_brick_csf <- brick(naip_stack_csf)

# view size of the brick
object.size(naip_brick_csf)

```

Notice that in the `RasterBrick`, all of the bands are stored within the actual
object. Thus, the `RasterBrick` object size is much larger than the
`RasterStack` object.

You use `plotRGB` to block a `RasterBrick` too.

``` {r plot-brick, fig.cap="plot raster brick"}
par(col.axis="white", col.lab="white", tck=0)
# plot brick
plotRGB(naip_brick_csf,
  main="NAIP plot from a rasterbrick",
  axes=T)
box(col="white") # turn all of the lines to white

```
