## <i class="fa fa-ship" aria-hidden="true"></i> Welcome to Week {{ page.week }}!

Welcome to week {{ page.week }} of Earth Analytics! This week we will learn about
understanding fire patterns and behaviour using spectral remote sensing data.
We will learn how to work with multi-band rasters in R. We will also learn some
important principles of remote sensing data. Finally we will learn how to calculate
vegetation indices in R.

## <i class="fa fa-pencil-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> Homework Submission

### Produce a .pdf report

Create a new `R markdown `document. Name it: **lastName-firstInitial-week6.Rmd**
Within your `.Rmd` document, include the plots listed below. When you are done
with your report, use `knitr` to convert it to `PDF` format. Submit both the
`.Rmd` file and the `.pdf` file. Be sure to name your files as instructed above!

#### Use knitr code chunk arguments
In your final report, use the following knitr code chunk arguments to hide messages
and warnings and code as you see fit.

* `message=F`, `warning=F` Hide warnings and messages in a code chunk
* `echo=F` Hide code and just show code output
* `results='hide'` Hide the verbose output from some functions like `readOGR()`.

#### Answer the following questions below in your report
1. What is the key difference between active and passive remote sensing system.
2. Describe *atleast* 3 differences between lidar vs landsat remote sensing data.
2. Explain what a vegetation index is.

#### Include the plots below.
For all plots
1. Be sure to describe what each plot shows in your final report using a figure
caption argument in your code chunks: `fig.cap="caption here".
2. Add appropriate titles that tells someone reading your report what the map shows

#### Plot 1
Create a MAP of the **difference between NDVI pre vs post fire** with Landsat data (Post fire - pre-fire NDVI).

#### Plot 2
Create a MAP of the **difference between NBR pre vs post fire** with Landsat data  (Pre fire - post-fire NBR). Classify that data using the classification thresholds below. Be sure to include a legend on your map that helps someone looking at it
understand differences.

| SEVERITY LEVEL  | NBR RANGE |
|------------------------------|
| Enhanced Regrowth | -700 to  -100  |
| Unburned       |  -100 to +100  |
| Low Severity     | +100 to +270  |
| Moderate Severity  | +270 to +660  |
| High Severity     |  +660 to +1300 |

Note: if your min and max NBR values are outside of the range above, you can adjust
-700 to be your smallest raster value and for high severity you can adjust 1300 to
be your largest NBR raster value.

#### Plot 3
Create a classified map of **post fire NDVI** with Landsat data using classification values that you
think make sense based upon exploring the data.

#### Plot 4
Create a map of **post fire NBR** with Landsat data.

## Homework due: Thursday March 2 2017 @ 5PM.
Submit your report in both `.Rmd` and `.PDF` format to the D2l dropbox.

## Grading

#### .Pdf Report structure & code: 10%

|  Full Credit | Partial Credit ~B | Partial Credit ~C | Partial Credit ~D | No Credit|
|---|---|---|---|---|
| PDF and RMD submitted |  | Only one of the 2 files are submitted  | | No files submitted |
| Code is written using "clean" code practices following the Hadley Wickham style guide| Spaces are placed after all # comment tags, variable names do not use periods, or function names. | Clean coding is used in some of the code but spaces or variable names are incorrect 2-4 times| | Clean coding is not implemented consistently throughout the report. |
| Code chunk contains code and runs  | All code runs in the document  | There are 1-2 errors in the code in the document that make it not run | | The are more than 3 code errors in the document |
| All required R packages are listed at the top of the document in a code chunk.  | | Some packages are listed at the top of the document and some are lower down. | | |
| Lines of code are broken up at commas to make the code more readable  | |  | | |


####  Knitr pdf output: 20%

|  Full Credit | Partial Credit ~B | Partial Credit ~C | Partial Credit ~D | No Credit|
|---|---|---|---|---|
