## <i class="fa fa-ship" aria-hidden="true"></i> Welcome to Week {{ page.week }}!

Welcome to week {{ page.week }} of Earth Analytics! In week 3 we will learn about
Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data. We will cover using point cloud data and
lidar rasters in `R` and will explore using QGIS - a free, open-source GIS tool.

Your final 2013 Colorado flood report assignment is below. Read the assignment
carefully and make sure you've completed all of the steps and followed all of the
guidelines. Use all of the class and homework lessons that we've reviewed in the
first few weeks to help you complete the assignment.

### 1. Readings

First - review ALL of the lessons for this week. We did not cover them all in class. This
includes the in class and homework lessons.

Read the following articles. They will help you write your report.

## <i class="fa fa-pencil-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> Homework submission

#### Produce a final report on the 2013 Floods

Create a new `R markdown `document. Name it: **lastName-firstInitial-floodreport.Rmd**
Within your `.Rmd` document, carefully compose a report that summarizes what you have
learned about the 2013 Colorado flood event. Use all of the plots that you have created
in the first 3 weeks of the class in your report as listed below.

When you are done with your report, use `knitr` to convert it to `PDF` format (note:
if you did not get `knitr` working it is ok if you create an html document and
export it to pdf as we demonstrated in class). You will submit both
the `.Rmd` file and the `.pdf` file. Be sure to name your files as instructed above!

Include the following parts in your report:

####  Background / overview of the flood

Include the following background in your report:

1. Describe where and when the disturbance event occurred.
2. Discussion of the drivers that yielded the flooding in Boulder and discussion of the impacts of the flood.

#### Your report should include 7 (or 8) Plots
Your report should include the following plots (in whatever order you think best
describes the events of the flood):

### Basemap plot from week 3:

* **PLOT 0:** A basemap showing the location of the stream gage / study area created using
`ggmap()`.

### Precip & discharge plots from week 2:

Use the `data/week2/precipitation/805325-precip-dailysum-2003-2013.csv`file to create:

* **PLOT 1:** a plot of precipitation from 2003 to 2013 using `ggplot()`.
* **PLOT 2:** a plot that shows precipitation SUBSETTED from Aug 15 - Oct 15 2013 using `ggplot()`.

Use the `data/week2/discharge/06730200-discharge-daily-1986-2013.csv` file to create:

* **PLOT 3:** a plot of stream discharge from 1986 to 2016 using `ggplot()`.
* **PLOT 4:** a plot that shows stream discharge SUBSETTED from Aug 15 - Oct 15 2013 using `ggplot()`.

### Raster plots from week 3:

* **PLOT 5:** A **classified** and **cropped** raster map that shows positive and negative change in the canopy height model before and after the flood. To do this you will need to calculate the difference between two canopy height models. Subtract the pre-flood CHM from the post-flood CHM (**post_flood_CHM - pre-flood-CHM**). The plot should be CROPPED using the crop_extent shapefile that is included in your data download. You should classify the plot using values that make
sense after reviewing the histogram of the data (created below).
* **PLOT 6:** A **classified** and **cropped** raster map that shows positive and negative change in terrain
derived from the pre and post flood Digital Terrain Models. Subtract the pre-flood DTM from the post-flood DTM (**post_flood_DTM - pre-flood-DTM**). The plot should be CROPPED using the crop_extent shapefile that is included in your data download. You should classify the plot using values that make
sense after reviewing the histogram of the data (created below).
* **PLOT 7** Create a HISTOGRAM of the **classified** and **cropped** raster map that shows positive and negative change in the canopy height model before and after the flood.
* **PLOT 8** Create a HISTOGRAM of the **classified** and **cropped** raster map that shows positive and negative change in terrain
derived from the pre and post flood Digital Terrain Models.

### Graduate students & anyone who did the bonus week 2 plot

* **PLOT 9:** A plot of precipitation that spans from 1948 - 2013 using the `805333-precip-daily-1948-2013.csv` file. Use the bonus lesson to guide you through creating this plot. This lesson will give you a more real world experience with working with less than perfect data!

For all plots use the readings from the last 3 weeks to discuss:

* Where the data came from and what the data shows.
* Discuss patterns that are evident in the data and potential relationships between
what you see in the lidar data compared to precipitation and discharge.


#### Summary / Discussion
End your report with a summary discussion of the flood events. Be sure to discuss
how the data help us better understand these types of disturbance events.


#### Important:

* Clearly state the source of each dataset that you use to create the plot in your report text.
* Make sure each plot has a clear **TITLE** and, where appropriate, **label the x and y axes**. Be sure to include **UNITS** in your labels!
* Analyze / interpret each plot that you produce in your report. State what the source of the data are and what the plot shows as a driver or impact of the 2013 flood events.
* Clearly document that steps that you took to process the data by commenting your code or in the text of your report itself as it makes sense.
* Cite **atleast 3** articles that you read or other sources of information that you used to write your report.
* Use clean coding practices - this includes comments, variable names that are informative, clean code spacing, following Hadley Wickham's code style guide.
* Make sure all of the libraries that you use in the report are listed in a code chunk at the TOP of your document.
* Spell check your report and check grammar.
* All plots should be clearly labeled with titles, and x and y axis labels are it makes sense. (Your map of lidar data doesn't need x and y labels).
* Be sure to discuss how you selected the classification values used in the raster plots referencing
the histograms of the data that you create.
* OPTIONAL BONUS: Include images as they make sense. Be sure to cite any graphics that you use that are not yours.


## Homework due: Feb 8 @ noon.
Submit your report in both `.Rmd` and `.PDF` format to the D2l dropbox by NOON Wednesday 8
