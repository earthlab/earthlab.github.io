## Access data programmatically

This week we will discuss programmatic access of data via Applied Programming
Interfaces (APIs). Up until this point, we have been downloading data from a
website (in the case of this course, <a href="https://figshare.com/authors/_/3386570" target="_blank">Figshare</a>). The data that we have downloaded
was prepared specifically for this course. However, downloading and unzipping data,
each week is not efficient. Sometimes we want to automate the data download process -
particularly when we are trying to download lots of data or particular subsets
of data to support an analysis.

### Download files programmatically

In week one of this course, we downloaded some data using the `download.file()`
function. In this case, we accessed data programmatically, but we first downloaded
it as a `.csv` to our computer, and then proceeded to work with it. This week,
we will learn about several ways to download / access data programmatically in `R`.
These ways include

1. Programmatic access to data via downloading a human-readable file
2. Programmatic access to data via accessing it via an Applied Programming Interface (API)

## What is an API?

An API is an interface that sits on top of a computer based system that simplifies
certain tasks such as - getting subsets of data from a large database.

> Web APIs are a way to strip away all the extraneous visual interface that
> you don’t care about and get the data that you want.

### Why Web APIs?

Among other things, APIs allow us to:

* Get information that would be time-consuming to get otherwise
* Get information that you can’t get otherwise
* Automate an analytical workflow that needs continuously updated data
* Access data using a more direct interface

### What is a Web-API?

Web API's allow us to access data available via an internet
web interface.

Often we can access data from web APIs via a URL that contains
sets of parameters that specifies the type and particular subset of data that
we are interested in.

If you have worked with a database such as `SQL` or `POSTSQL`, or if you've ever
queried data from a GIS system like ArcGIS, then you can compare the set of
parameters associated with a URL string to a SQL query.


### Restful web APIs

There are many different types of web APIs. One of the most common types is
a `REST`, or `REST`ful, API. A *RESTful* API is a web API that uses
a URL arguments to specify what information you want returned through the API.

### Colorado Population Projections

The [Colorado Information Marketplace](https://data.colorado.gov) is a
comprehensive data warehouse with access to a wide range of Colorado-specific
open datasets available via a RESTful API called the Socrata Open Data API (SODA)

There are lots of API *endpoints* or data sets available via this API. One
endpoint contains  <a href="https://data.colorado.gov/resource/tv8u-hswn.json" target="_blank">Colorado Population Projections:</a>.
If you go to this site, you will see data returned
in a `JSON` format. These data includes population estimates for *males* and
*females* for every *county* in Colorado for every *year* from 1990 to 2040 for
multiple *age* groups!

### URL Parameters

Using `URL` parameters, we can define a more specific request to limit what data
we get back in response to our API request. For example, if we only want data for
Boulder, Colorado, we can query just that subset of the data using the RESTful call.

note the **?&county=Boulder** part of the url:

<a href="https://data.colorado.gov/resource/tv8u-hswn.json?&county=Boulder" target="_blank">Like this - https://data.colorado.gov/resource/tv8u-hswn.json?&county=Boulder</a>.

Parameters associated with accessing data using this API are <a href="https://dev.socrata.com/foundry/data.colorado.gov/tv8u-hswn" target="_blank">documented here</a>.

## Using SOAP

`SOAP` also allows us to specify more complex 'queries'. Here's the API `URL`
for population projections for female Boulderites aged 20--40 for the years 2016-2025:

<a href="https://data.colorado.gov/resource/tv8u-hswn.json?$where=age between 20 and 40 and year between 2016 and 2025&county=Boulder&$select=year,age,femalepopulation" target="_blank"> https://data.colorado.gov/resource/tv8u-hswn.json?$where=age between 20 and 40 and year between 2016 and 2025&county=Boulder&$select=year,age,femalepopulation</a>.

### API Response

The data that are returned from an API are called the response. The format of the
returned data or the response is most often in the form of plain text 'file'
such as a `JSON` or `CSV` file.

For many APIs, you can specify the file [that you want to be returned](https://dev.socrata.com/docs/formats/index.html).



[`https://data.colorado.gov/resource/tv8u-hswn.`**`{json, csv, geojson, xml}`**](https://data.colorado.gov/resource/tv8u-hswn.json)

Notice that the first few rows of data returned via the query above with a `.csv`
suffix look like this:

```json
"age","femalepopulation","year"
"32","2007","2024"
"35","1950","2016"
"37","2039","2019"
"30","2087","2025"
"26","1985","2019"
...
```

For example, take a close look at the URL below that access <a href="http://data.colorado.gov" target="_blank">http://data.colorado.gov </a>. This is the Colorado state
data repository.

Next, have a look at an API access URL to some data hosted on this site here:

<a href="https://data.colorado.gov/Demographics/Population-Colorado/eeah-cmy8" target="_blank">View Colorado state population project data in tabular form.</a>

Finally, let's look at the URL which access the API to download the data directly,


<a href="https://data.colorado.gov/resource/tv8u-hswn.json?$where=age%20between%2020%20and%2040%20and%20year%20between%202016%20and%202025&county=Boulder&$select=year,age,femalepopulation" target="_blank">https://data.colorado.gov/resource/tv8u-hswn.json?$where=age%20between%2020%20and%2040%20and%20year%20between%202016%20and%202025&county=Boulder&$select=year,age,femalepopulation</a>


Notice that the URL above, which is accessing the `colorado.data.gov` API, starts with
`data.colorado.gov` but then has various parameters attached to the end of the URL
that specify the particular type of information that we are looking for.

A few of the parameters that we can see in the url below are listed below:

* **The Data set itself:** /tv8u-hswn.json
* **AGE:** where=age%20
* **YEAR:** between%2020%20and%2040
* **COUNTY:** county=Boulder
* **Columns to get:** select=year,age,femalepopulation

We will work with these data in R directly in the following lessons, but for now
just notice how the API access works in this case.

1. Data **REQUEST**: You try to access a `URL` in your browser.
2. **Data processing:** A web server somewhere uses that url to query a specified dataset.
3. Data **RESPONSE**: That web server then sends you back some content.


## download.file() vs. a API call

The biggest difference between downloading data directly
and using an API call is that an ordinary `URL` sends back
**human-readable** information. A  web API `URL` sends back **computer-readable**
information.

Let's have a closer look at the data that the Colorado.gov API data returns.
These data are returned in **JSON** format - which we will discuss in  more detail
later in this week's lessons.


```json
[ {
  "totalpopulation" : "4758",
  "year" : "1990",
  "county" : "Adams",
  "malepopulation" : "2354.00",
  "fipscode" : "1",
  "femalepopulation" : "2404.00",
  "age" : "0"
}
, {
  "totalpopulation" : "4720",
  "year" : "1990",
  "county" : "Adams",
  "malepopulation" : "2345.00",
  "fipscode" : "1",
  "femalepopulation" : "2375.00",
  "age" : "1"
}]

```

Notice **JSON** is a structured format. The consistency of its structure makes
it easier for us to access and work with it programmatically. This is a
**computer readable** format.

### Working with APIs

To use an API we need to understand 2 components:

- **Parameters:** Information that you supply *within* the URL to define your request
- **Response:** Something you get back in response to a request

The parameters
The **response** may be:
1. Some *data* or
2. An explanation of why your request *failed*

### Using APIs

So, how do we learn more about APIs? Below are some resources ...

* <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com" target="_blank">Find APIs and read more about them</a>
* <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/overview/documentation" target="_blank">Twitter API documentation</a>
* <a href="http://developer.nytimes.com/docs" target="_blank">New York times API information</a>
* <a href="https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api" target="_blank">Weather underground API information</a>
* <a href="http://envirocar.github.io/enviroCar-server/api/" target="_blank">EnviroCar API information</a>
* <a href="http://developer.nytimes.com/docs" target="_blank">New York times API information</a>

The documentation in the URL's above describes the different types of *requests*
that we can make to the data provider. For each request `URL` we need to specify
the parameters and consider the response.
