After completing this tutorial, you will be able to:

* Define what a namespace is relative to using R.
* Explicetly call a function from a particular namespace in R.

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning=FALSE)

```


In this lesson, we will learn about namespaces and how they can impact function
calls in R.

```{r}
# load packages
library(ggmap)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
library("knitr")
```

Let's start by creating an API rest call to the colorado information warehouse
website. We used this call in the previous lesson. We know it works!


```{r get-api-url}
# Base URL path
base_url = "https://data.colorado.gov/resource/tv8u-hswn.json?"
full_url = paste0(base_url, "county=Boulder",
             "&$where=age between 20 and 40",
             "&$select=year,age,femalepopulation")
# view full url
full_url
```

Next, let's import that data using `fromJSON()`. Notice that we called the
rjson library to use `fromJSON()`. What happens?

```{r}
library(rjson)
# Convert JSON to data frame
pop_proj_data_df <- fromJSON(full_url)

```

The code above returns an error.  Notice that the URL that we have passed has space
in it. As we did in the previous lesson, we can use the URLencode function to
replace those spaces with ascii values (`%20`). Let's give that a try.

```{r}
# view url - notice spaces
full_url
# encode spaces with ascii value %20
full_url <- URLencode(full_url)
full_url
# Convert JSON api returned value to data frame
pop_proj_data_df <- fromJSON(full_url)
head(pop_proj_data_df)
```


```{r}
library(rjson)
# Convert JSON to data frame
# Base URL path
base_url = "https://data.colorado.gov/resource/tv8u-hswn.json?"
full_url = paste0(base_url, "county=Boulder",
             "&$where=age between 20 and 40",
             "&$select=year,age,femalepopulation")
# view full url
full_url
pop_proj_data_df <- fromJSON(full_url)
```

What happened in the code above? Above, we used the same code but got a different 
error! Notice one small change - we called a new library - rjson. 

Let's look at the above examples in more detail to understand why we are getting 
different error messages from the SAME function `fromJSON()`. Because different people 
and groups create different R packages, AND you also may create functions in your 
code, the same function can exist in different packages. 

We can explicetly tell R to use a function from a particular package using the 
syntax `packageName::function()`. In this case, there are (atleast) 3 r packages that have
the same fromJSON() function:

1. RJSONIO
1. rjson
1. jsonlite

Let's see what happens when we call the same function from each package. 


```{r}
# notice the url has spaces
full_url

pop_proj_data_df <- jsonlite::fromJSON(full_url)
pop_proj_data_df <- rjson::fromJSON(full_url)
pop_proj_data_df <- RJSONIO::fromJSON(full_url)
```

Above, notice that we get 3 unique errors from the same function call. HOwever, each 
time we called the function from a different package!

Next, let's see which of these functions plays nicely if we encode the URL first,
and then try to open the data! 


```{r}
# notice the url has spaces
full_url
# encode the url
full_url_encoded <- URLencode(full_url)
full_url_encoded


pop_proj_data_df <- jsonlite::fromJSON(full_url_encoded)
head(pop_proj_data_df)

```

Looks like it works when we use fromJSON from the jsonlite package. How about the 
rjson package?


```{r}
pop_proj_data_df1 <- rjson::fromJSON(full_url_encoded)
```

The above example still doesn't work, even when we encode our url string. What 
happens if you use getURL to grab the URL?

```{r}
pop_proj_geturl <- getURL(full_url_encoded)
pop_proj_data_df1 <- rjson::fromJSON(pop_proj_geturl)
head(pop_proj_data_df1, n=2)

```

Well the above works WHEN we first use the getURL() function from the RCurl package!
However, it returns a list rather than a data.frame with columns and rows. In this 
case we have to change our workflow. We need to convert the list to a data.frame.

We can do that using do.call on the rbind.data.frame() function as follows:

```{r}
pop_proj_df_convert <- do.call(rbind.data.frame, pop_proj_data_df1)
head(pop_proj_df_convert)
```

That works - but it made us use additional code. Seems like the jsonlite example
is our best path forward! This is especially true given we will have nested 
data.frames in the lessons to follow and it's easy to deal with those in a data.frame
format! 

```{r}
pop_proj_data_df2 <- RJSONIO::fromJSON(full_url_encoded)
head(pop_proj_data_df2, n=2)
```

Here we see different results jet from the RJSONIO package. We would need to once 
again convert a list to a data.frame. You get the idea...

The takeaway from all of this is that you need to be aware of what packages 
you have loaded in your environment and the potential for several functions to 
'conflict'. The best work around in this case is to be explicit about what 
package you want to call your function from. Example:

`jsonlite::fromJSON()` rather than simply using fromJSON().
