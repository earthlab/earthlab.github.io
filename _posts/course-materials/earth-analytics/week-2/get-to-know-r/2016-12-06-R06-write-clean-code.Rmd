This lesson reviews best practices associated with clean coding.

<div class='notice--success' markdown="1">

## <i class="fa fa-graduation-cap" aria-hidden="true"></i> Learning Objectives
At the end of this activity, you will be able to:

* write code using Hadley Wickham's style guide

## What You Need

You need `R` and `RStudio` to complete this tutorial. Also we recommend have you
have an `earth-analytics` directory setup on your computer with a `/data`
directory with it.

* [Setup your working directory](/course-materials/earth-analytics/week-1/setup-working-directory/)

Clean code means that your code is organized in a way that is easy for you and
for someone else to follow / read. Certain conventions are suggested to make code
easier to read. For example, many guides suggest the use of a space after a comment.
Like so:

```r
#poorly formatted  comments are missing the space after the pound sign.
# good comments have a space after the pound sign
```

While these types of guidelines may seem unimportant when you first begin to code,
after a while you're realize that consistently formatted code is much easier
for your eye to scan and quickly understand.

## Consistent, Clean Code

Take some time to review <a href="http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html" target="_blank">Hadley Wickham's style guide</a>. From here on in, we will
follow this guide for all of the assignments in this class.

## Object Naming Best Practices

1. **Keep object names short:** this makes them easier to read when scanning through code.
2. **Use meaningful names:** For example: `precip` is a more useful name that tells us something about the object compared to `x`
3. **Don't start names with numbers!** Objects that start with a number are NOT VALID in R.
4. **Avoid names that are existing functions in R:** e.g.,
`if`, `else`, `for`, see
[here](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/Reserved.html)

A few other notes about object names in `R`:

* `R` is case sensitive (e.g., `weight_kg` is different from `Weight_kg`).
* Avoid other function names (e.g., `c`, `T`, `mean`, `data`, `df`, `weights`).
* Use nouns for variable names, and verbs for function names.
* Avoid using dots in object names - e.g. `my.dataset` - dots have a special meaning in R (for methods) and other programming languages. Instead use underscores `my_dataset`.

## <i class="fa fa-pencil-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> Challenge

Take a look at the code below.

* Create a list of all of the things that could be improved to make the code
easier to read / work with.
* Add to that list things that don't fit the Hadley Wickham style guide standards.
* Try to run the code in R. Any issues?

<!--
FORMAT Issues:
missing spaces in between comments
comments aren't useful to help me understand what is happening

OBJECT NAMING
- didn't use useful object names that describe the object
- used a number to name a variable
- one very long object name
- used a mixture of underscore and case that will be easy to confuse
- used a . in an object name
