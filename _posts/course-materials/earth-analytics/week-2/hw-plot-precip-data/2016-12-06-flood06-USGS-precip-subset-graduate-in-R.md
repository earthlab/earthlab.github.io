Bonus / graduate activity. In this lesson, you will PLOT precipitation data in R.
However, these data were collected over several decades and sometimes there are
multiple data points per day. The data are also not cleaned. You will find
heading names that may not be meaningful, and other issues with the data.

This lesson provides the basic skills that you need to create a plot of daily
precipitation, for 30 years surrounding the 2013 flood. You will use the skills
that you learned in the previous lessons, coupled with the skills in this lesson
to process the data.

## Work with Precipitation Data

## R Libraries

To get started, load the `ggplot2` and `dplyr` libraries, setup your working
directory and set `stringsAsFactors` to FALSE using `options()`.




## Import Precipitation Data

We will use the `805333-precip_daily_1948-2013.csv` dataset for this assignment.
in this analysis. This dataset contains the precipitation values collected daily
from the COOP station 050843 in Boulder, CO for 1 January 2003 through 31 December 2013.

Import the data into R and then view the data structure.

## About the Data

The structure of the data are similar to what you saw in previous lessons. HPCP
is the total precipitation given in inches, recorded
for the hour ending at the time specified by DATE. There is a designated missing
data value of 999.99. Note that hours with no precipitation are not recorded.


The metadata for this file is located in your week2 directory:
`PRECIP_HLY_documentation.pdf` file that can be downloaded along with the data.
(Note, as of Sept. 2016, there is a mismatch in the data downloaded and the
documentation. The differences are in the units and missing data value:
inches/999.99 (standard) or millimeters/25399.75 (metric)).

### NoData Values

Next, check out the data. Are there no data values? If so, make sure to adjust your
data import code above to account for no data values. Then determine how many no
data values you have in your dataset.

![histogram of data]({{ site.url }}/images/rfigs/course-materials/earth-analytics/week-2/hw-plot-precip-data/2016-12-06-flood06-USGS-precip-subset-graduate-in-R/no-data-values-hist-1.png)![histogram of data]({{ site.url }}/images/rfigs/course-materials/earth-analytics/week-2/hw-plot-precip-data/2016-12-06-flood06-USGS-precip-subset-graduate-in-R/no-data-values-hist-2.png)



```r
print("how many NA values are there?")
## [1] "how many NA values are there?"
sum(is.na(precip.boulder))
## [1] 401
```

### Convert Date and Time

Compared to the previous lessons, notice that we now have date & time in our date field.
To deal with both date and time, we use the `as.POSIXct()` method rather than
as.date which we used previously. The syntax to convert to POSIXct is similar to
what we used previously, but now, we will add the hour (H) and minute (M) to the
format argument as follows:

`as.POSIXct(column-you-want-to-convert-here, format="%Y%m%d %H:%M")`



* For more information on date/time classes, see the NEON tutorial
<a href="http://neondataskills.org/R/time-series-convert-date-time-class-POSIX/" target="_blank"> *Dealing With Dates & Times in R - as.Date, POSIXct, POSIXlt*</a>.


## Plot Precipitation Data

Next, let's have a look at the data. Plot using `ggplot()`. Format the plot using
the colors, labels, etc that are most clear and look the best. Your plot does not
need to look like the one below!


```
## Warning: Removed 401 rows containing missing values (position_stack).
```

![hourly precipitation]({{ site.url }}/images/rfigs/course-materials/earth-analytics/week-2/hw-plot-precip-data/2016-12-06-flood06-USGS-precip-subset-graduate-in-R/plot-precip-hourly-1.png)

These data are hard to look at. And really we only need to explore 30 years or so.
Let's do the following

1. aggregate the precipitation totals (sum) by day.
2. subset the data for 30 years.

#### Aggregating and summarizing data

To aggregate data by a particular variable or time period, we can create a new column
in our dataset called day. We will take all of the values for each day and add them
using the `sum()` function. We can do all of this efficiently using dplyr mutate() function.

We use the `mutate()` function to add a new column called **day** to a new data.frame called **daily_sum_precip**. Note that we used `as.Date()` to just grab the dates rather than dates and times which are stored in the POSIX format.



```r
# use dplyr
daily_sum_precip <- precip.boulder %>%
  # create a new field called day and populate it with just the date
  mutate(day = as.Date(DATE, format="%Y-%m-%d")) 

# let's look at the new column
head(daily_sum_precip$day)
## [1] "1948-08-01" "1948-08-02" "1948-08-03" "1948-08-03" "1948-08-03"
## [6] "1948-08-04"
```
![Daily precip plot]({{ site.url }}/images/rfigs/course-materials/earth-analytics/week-2/hw-plot-precip-data/2016-12-06-flood06-USGS-precip-subset-graduate-in-R/plot-daily-1.png)

Next we `summarize()` the precipitation column (total_precip) - grouped by day.
What this means is that we ADD UP all of the values for each day to get a grand
total amount of precipitation each day.



```r
# use dplyr
daily_sum_precip <- precip.boulder %>%
  mutate(day = as.Date(DATE, format="%Y-%m-%d")) %>%
  group_by(day) %>% # group by the day column
  summarise(total_precip=sum(HPCP)) # calculate the SUM of all precipitation that occured on each day

# how large is the resulting data frame?
nrow(daily_sum_precip)
## [1] 4899

# view the results
head(daily_sum_precip)
## # A tibble: 6 Ã— 2
##          day total_precip
##       <date>        <dbl>
## 1 1948-08-01         0.00
## 2 1948-08-02         0.05
## 3 1948-08-03         0.07
## 4 1948-08-04         0.14
## 5 1948-08-06         0.02
## 6 1948-08-14         0.03

# view column names
names(daily_sum_precip)
## [1] "day"          "total_precip"
```


Now plot the daily data.


```
## Warning: Removed 323 rows containing missing values (position_stack).
```

## have them create a few plots over different time scales
## how to aggregate by month, by week -- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11395927/how-to-subset-data-frame-by-weeks-and-then-sum


Now we can easily see the dramatic rainfall event in mid-September!

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **R Tip:** If you are using a date-time class, instead
of just a date class, you need to use `scale_x_datetime()`.

#### Subset The Data

Now let's create a subset of the data and plot it.
filter between 1993-12-31 - 2013-12-31


```r

# use dplyr
daily_sum_precip_subset <- daily_sum_precip %>%
  filter(day >= as.Date('2003-08-15') & day <= as.Date('2013-12-31'))


# create new plot
precPlot_30yrs <- ggplot(daily_sum_precip_subset, aes(day, total_precip)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity") +
  xlab("Date") + ylab("Precipitation (inches)") +
  ggtitle("Daily Total Precipitation Aug - Oct 2013 for Boulder Creek")

precPlot_30yrs
## Warning: Removed 59 rows containing missing values (position_stack).
```

## Additional Resources

### Units & Scale
If you are using a dataset downloaded before 2016, the units were in
**hundredths of an inch**. You might want to
create a new column `PRECIP` that contains the data from `HPCP` converted to
inches.


```r

# convert from 100th inch by dividing by 100
precip.boulder$PRECIP<-precip.boulder$HPCP/100

# view & check to make sure conversion occured
head(precip.boulder)
