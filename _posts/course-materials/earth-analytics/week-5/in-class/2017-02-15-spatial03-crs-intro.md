## Intro to coordinate reference systems

The short video below highlights how map projections can make continents
look proportionally larger or smaller than they actually are.

## What is a Coordinate Reference System

To define the location of something we often use a coordinate system. This system
consists of an X and a Y value located within a 2 (or more) -dimensional space.

While the above coordinate system is 2-dimensional, we live on a 3-dimensional
earth that happens to be "round". To define the location of objects on the earth, which is round, we need
a coordinate system that adapts to the Earth's shape. When we make maps on paper
or on a flat computer screen, we move from a 3-Dimensional space (the globe) to
a 2-Dimensional space (our computer
screens or a piece of paper). The components of the CRS define how the
"flattening" of data that exists in a 3-D globe space. The CRS also defines the
the coordinate system itself.

coordinate-based local, regional or global system used to locate geographical
entities. -- Wikipedia

## The Components of a CRS

The coordinate reference system is made up of several key components:

* **Coordinate System:** the X, Y grid upon which our data is overlayed and how we define where a point is located in space.
* **Horizontal and vertical units:** The units used to define the grid along the
x, y (and z) axis.
* **Datum:** A modeled version of the shape of the earth which defines the
origin used to place the coordinate system in space. We will explain this further,
below.
* **Projection Information:** the mathematical equation used to flatten objects
that are on a round surface (e.g. the earth) so we can view them on a flat surface
(e.g. our computer screens or a paper map).

## Why CRS is Important

It is important to understand the coordinate system that your data uses -
particularly if you are working with different data stored in different coordinate
systems. If you have data from the same location that are stored in different
coordinate reference systems, **they will not line up in any GIS or other program**
unless you have a program like ArcGIS or QGIS that supports **projection on the
fly**. Even if you work in a tool that supports projection on the fly, you will
want to all of your data in the same projection for performing analysis and processing
tasks.

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip:** Spatialreference.org provides an
excellent <a href="http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/" target="_blank">online
library of CRS information.</a>

### Coordinate System & Units

We can define a spatial location, such as a plot location, using an x- and a
y-value - similar to our cartesian coordinate system displayed in the figure,
above.

For example, the map below, generated in `R` with `ggplot2` shows all of the
continents in the world, in a `Geographic` Coordinate Reference System. The
units are Degrees and the coordinate system itself is **latitude** and
**longitude** with the `origin` being the location where the equator meets
the central meridian on the globe (0,0).



```r

# devtools::install_github("tidyverse/ggplot2")
# load libraries
library(rgdal)
library(ggplot2)
library(rgeos)
library(raster)

#install.packages('sf')
# testing the sf package out for these lessons!
library(sf)
# set your working directory
# setwd("~/Documents/earth-analytics/")
```

In the plot below, we will be using the following theme. You can copy and paste
this code if you'd like to use the same theme!


```r
# turn off axis elements in ggplot for better visual comparison
newTheme <- list(theme(line = element_blank(),
      axis.text.x = element_blank(),
      axis.text.y = element_blank(),
      axis.ticks = element_blank(), # turn off ticks
      axis.title.x = element_blank(), # turn off titles
      axis.title.y = element_blank(),
      legend.position="none")) # turn off legend
```


```
## Error: Each variable must be a 1d atomic vector or list.
## Problem variables: 'geometry'

```r
# read shapefile
worldBound <- readOGR(dsn="data/week5/global/ne_110m_land",
                     layer="ne_110m_land")
# convert to dataframe
worldBound_df <- fortify(worldBound)
```


```r
# plot map using ggplot
worldMap <- ggplot(worldBound_df, aes(long,lat, group=group)) +
  geom_polygon() +
  coord_equal() +
  labs(x="Longitude (Degrees)",
       y="Latitude (Degrees)",
      title="Global Map - Geographic Coordinate System ",
      subtitle = "WGS84 Datum, Units: Degrees - Latitude / Longitude")

worldMap
```

<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/rfigs/course-materials/earth-analytics/week-5/in-class/2017-02-15-spatial03-crs-intro/load-plot-data-1.png" title="world map plot" alt="world map plot" width="100%" />

We can add three coordinate locations to our map. Note that the UNITS are
in decimal **degrees** (latitude, longitude):

* **Boulder, Colorado:** 40.0274, -105.2519
* **Oslo, Norway:** 59.9500, 10.7500
* **Mallorca, Spain:** 39.6167, 2.9833

Let's create a second map with the locations overlayed on top of the continental
boundary layer.


```r
# define locations of Boulder, CO, Mallorca, Spain and  Oslo, Norway
# store coordinates in a data.frame
loc_df <- data.frame(lon=c(-105.2519, 10.7500, 2.9833),
                lat=c(40.0274, 59.9500, 39.6167))

# add a point to the map
mapLocations <- worldMap +
                geom_point(data=loc_df,
                aes(x=lon, y=lat, group=NULL), colour = "springgreen",
                      size=5)

mapLocations
```

## Geographic CRS - The Good & The Less Good

Geographic coordinate systems in decimal degrees are helpful when we need to
locate places on the Earth. However, latitude and longitude
locations are not located using uniform measurement units. Thus, geographic
CRSs are not ideal for measuring distance. This is why other projected `CRS`
have been developed.

	and south is not uniform.

## Projected CRS - Robinson

We can view the same data above, in another CRS - `Robinson`. `Robinson` is a
**projected** `CRS`. Notice that the country boundaries on the map - have a
different shape compared to the map that we created above in the `CRS`:
**Geographic lat/long WGS84**.


```r
# reproject data from longlat to robinson CRS
worldBound_robin <- spTransform(worldBound,
                                CRS("+proj=robin"))

worldBound_df_robin <- fortify(worldBound_robin)

# force R to plot x and y values without rounding digits
# options(scipen=100)

robMap <- ggplot(worldBound_df_robin, aes(long,lat, group=group)) +
  geom_polygon() +
  labs(title="World map (robinson)",
       x = "X Coordinates (meters)",
       y ="Y Coordinates (meters)") +
  coord_equal()

robMap
```

<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/rfigs/course-materials/earth-analytics/week-5/in-class/2017-02-15-spatial03-crs-intro/global-map-robinson-1.png" title="Map reprojected to robinson projection." alt="Map reprojected to robinson projection." width="100%" />

Now what happens if you try to add the same Lat / Long coordinate locations that
we used above, to our map, that is using the `Robinson` `CRS` as it's coordinate
reference system?


```r
# add a point to the map
newMap <- robMap + geom_point(data=loc_df,
                      aes(x=lon, y=lat, group=NULL),
                      colour = "springgreen",
                      size=5)

newMap
```

<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/rfigs/course-materials/earth-analytics/week-5/in-class/2017-02-15-spatial03-crs-intro/add-locations-robinson-1.png" title="map with point locations added - robinson projection." alt="map with point locations added - robinson projection." width="100%" />

Notice above that when we try to add lat/long coordinates in degrees to a map
in a different `CRS`, that the points are not in the correct location. We need
to first convert the points to thenew projection - a process called
**reprojection**. We can reproject our data using the `spTransform()` function
in `R`.

Our points are stored in a data.frame which is not a spatial object. Thus, we will
need to convert that data.frame to a spatial data.frame to use spTransform().


```r
# data.frame containing locations of Boulder, CO and Oslo, Norway
loc_df
##         lon     lat
## 1 -105.2519 40.0274
## 2   10.7500 59.9500
## 3    2.9833 39.6167

# convert dataframe to spatial points data frame
loc_spdf<- SpatialPointsDataFrame(coords = loc_df, data=loc_df,
                            proj4string=crs(worldBound))

loc_spdf
## class       : SpatialPointsDataFrame 
## features    : 3 
## extent      : -105.2519, 10.75, 39.6167, 59.95  (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)
## coord. ref. : +proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs +ellps=WGS84 +towgs84=0,0,0 
## variables   : 2
## names       :       lon,     lat 
## min values  : -105.2519, 39.6167 
## max values  :     10.75,   59.95
```

Once we have converted our data frame into a spatial data frame, we can then
reproject our data.


```r
# reproject data to Robinson
loc_spdf_rob <- spTransform(loc_spdf, CRSobj = CRS("+proj=robin"))
```

To make our data place nicely with ggplot, we need to once again convert to a
dataframe. We can do that by extracting the `coordinates()` and turning that into
a data.frame using as.data.frame().


```r
# convert the spatial object into a data frame
loc_rob_df <- as.data.frame(coordinates(loc_spdf_rob))

# add a point to the map
newMap <- robMap + geom_point(data=loc_rob_df,
                      aes(x=lon, y=lat, group=NULL),
                      colour = "springgreen",
                      size=5)

newMap
```

<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/rfigs/course-materials/earth-analytics/week-5/in-class/2017-02-15-spatial03-crs-intro/plot-new-map-1.png" title="Map of the globe in robinson projection." alt="Map of the globe in robinson projection." width="100%" />

## Compare Maps

Both of the plots above look visually different and also use a different
coordinate system. Let's look at both, side by side, with the actual **graticules**
or latitude and longitude lines rendered on the map.

To visually see the difference in these projections as they impact parts of the
world, we will use a graticules layer which contains the mediaian and parallel
lines.


```r
## import graticule shapefile data
graticule <- readOGR("data/week5/global/ne_110m_graticules_all",
                     layer="ne_110m_graticules_15")
# convert spatial sp object into a ggplot ready, data.frame
graticule_df <- fortify(graticule)
```

Let's check out our graticules. Notice they are just parellels and meridians.


```r
# plot graticules
ggplot() +
  geom_path(data=graticule_df, aes(long, lat, group=group), linetype="dashed", color="grey70")
```

<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/rfigs/course-materials/earth-analytics/week-5/in-class/2017-02-15-spatial03-crs-intro/plot-grat-1.png" title="graticules plot" alt="graticules plot" width="100%" />

Also we will import a bounding box to make our plot look nicer!


```r
bbox <- readOGR("data/week5/global/ne_110m_graticules_all/ne_110m_wgs84_bounding_box.shp")
bbox_df <- fortify(bbox)

latLongMap <- ggplot(bbox_df, aes(long,lat, group=group)) +
              geom_polygon(fill="white") +
              geom_polygon(data=worldBound_df, aes(long,lat, group=group, fill=hole)) +
              geom_path(data=graticule_df, aes(long, lat, group=group), linetype="dashed", color="grey70") +
  coord_equal() +  labs(title="World Map - Geographic (long/lat degrees)")  +
  newTheme +

  scale_fill_manual(values=c("black", "white"), guide="none") # change colors & remove legend

# add our location points to the map
latLongMap <- latLongMap +
              geom_point(data=loc_df,
                      aes(x=lon, y=lat, group=NULL),
                      colour="springgreen",
                      size=5)
```

Below, we reproject our graticules and the bounding box to the robinson projection.


```r
# reproject grat into robinson
graticule_robin <- spTransform(graticule, CRS("+proj=robin"))  # reproject graticule
grat_df_robin <- fortify(graticule_robin)
bbox_robin <- spTransform(bbox, CRS("+proj=robin"))  # reproject bounding box
bbox_robin_df <- fortify(bbox_robin)

# plot using robinson

finalRobMap <- ggplot(bbox_robin_df, aes(long, lat, group=group)) +
  geom_polygon(fill="white") +
  geom_polygon(data=worldBound_df_robin, aes(long, lat, group=group, fill=hole)) +
  geom_path(data=grat_df_robin, aes(long, lat, group=group), linetype="dashed", color="grey70") +
  labs(title="World Map Projected - Robinson (Meters)") +
  coord_equal() + newTheme +
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("black", "white"), guide="none") # change colors & remove legend

# add a location layer in robinson as points to the map
finalRobMap <- finalRobMap + geom_point(data=loc_rob,
                      aes(x=X, y=Y, group=NULL),
                      colour="springgreen",
                      size=5)
```

Below we plot the two maps on top of each other to make them easier to compare.
To do this, we use the `grid.arrange()` function from the gridExtra package.


```r
require(gridExtra)
# display side by side
grid.arrange(latLongMap, finalRobMap)
```

## Why Multiple CRS?

You may be wondering, why bother with different CRSs if it makes our
analysis more complicated? Well, each `CRS` is optimized to best represent the:

* shape and/or
* scale / distance and/or
* area

of features in the data. And no one CRS is great at optimizing all three elements: shape, distance AND
area. Some CRSs are optimized for shape, some are optimized for distance and
some are optimized for area. Some
CRSs are also optimized for particular regions -
for instance the United States, or Europe. Discussing `CRS` as it optimizes shape,
distance and area is beyond the scope of this tutorial, but it's important to
understand that the `CRS` that you chose for your data, will impact working with
the data.

We will discuss some of the differences between the projected UTM CRS and geographic
WGS84 in the next lesson.

<div class="notice--warning" markdown="1">

## <i class="fa fa-pencil-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> Optional challenge

1. Compare the maps of the globe above. What do you notice about the shape of the
various countries. Are there any signs of distortion in certain areas on either
map? Which one is better?

2. Look at the image below which depicts maps of the United States in 4 different
`CRS`s. What visual differences do you notice in each map? Look up each projection
online, what elements (shape,area or distance) does each projection used in
the graphic below optimize?

## Geographic vs. Projected CRS

The above maps provide examples of the two main types of coordinate systems:

1. **Geographic coordinate systems:** coordinate systems that span the entire
globe (e.g. latitude / longitude).
2. **Projected coordinate Systems:** coordinate systems that are localized to
minimize visual distortion in a particular region (e.g. Robinson, UTM, State Plane)

We will discuss these two coordinate reference systems types in more detail
in the next lesson.
