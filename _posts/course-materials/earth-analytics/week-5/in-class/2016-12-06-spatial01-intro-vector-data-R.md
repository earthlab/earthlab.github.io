## About Vector Data
Vector data are composed of discrete geometric locations (x,y values) known as
**vertices** that define the "shape" of the spatial object. The organization
of the vertices, determines the type of vector that we are working
with: point, line or polygon.

    <figcaption> There are 3 types of vector objects: points, lines or
    polygons. Each object type has a different structure.

</figure>

* **Points:** Each individual point is defined by a single x, y coordinate.
There can be many points in a vector point file. Examples of point data include:
sampling locations, the location of individual trees or the location of plots.
* **Lines:** Lines are composed of many (at least 2) vertices, or points, that
are connected. For instance, a road or a stream may be represented by a line. This
line is composed of a series of segments, each "bend" in the road or stream
represents a vertex that has defined `x, y` location.
* **Polygons:** A polygon consists of 3 or more vertices that are connected and
"closed". Thus the outlines of plot boundaries, lakes, oceans, and states or
countries are often represented by polygons. Occasionally, a polygon can have a
hole in the middle of it (like a doughnut), this is something to be aware of but
not an issue we will deal with in this tutorial.

 <i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip:** Sometimes, boundary layers such as
 states and countries, are stored as lines rather than polygons. However, these
 boundaries, when represented as a line, will not create a closed object with a defined "area" that can be "filled".
{: .notice}

## Shapefiles: Points, Lines, and Polygons
Geospatial data in vector format are often stored in a `shapefile` format.
Because the structure of points, lines, and polygons are different, each
individual shapefile can only contain one vector type (all points, all lines
or all polygons). You will not find a mixture of point, line and polygon
objects in a single shapefile.

Objects stored in a shapefile often have a set of associated `attributes` that
describe the data. For example, a line shapefile that contains the locations of
streams, might contain the associated stream name, stream "order" and other
information about each stream line object.

* More about shapefiles can found on
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>.

## Import Shapefiles

We will use the `rgdal` package to work with vector data in `R`. Notice that the
`sp` package automatically loads when `rgdal` is loaded. We will also load the
`raster` package so we can explore raster and vector spatial metadata using similar commands.


```r
# work with spatial data; sp package will load with rgdal.
library(rgdal)
# for metadata/attributes- vectors or rasters
library(raster)

# set working directory to earth-analytics dir
# setwd("pathToDirHere")
```

The shapefiles that we will import are:

* A polygon shapefile representing our field site boundary,
* A line shapefile representing roads, and
* A point shapefile representing the location of the Fisher
<a href="http://www.neonscience.org/science-design/collection-methods/flux-tower-measurements" target="_blank">flux tower</a>
located at the
<a href="http://www.neonscience.org/science-design/field-sites/harvard-forest" target="_blank"> San Joachin field site</a>.

The first shapefile that we will open contains the boundary of our study area
(or our Area Of Interest or AOI, hence the name `aoiBoundary`). To import
shapefiles we use the `R` function `readOGR()`.

`readOGR()` requires two components:

1. The directory where our shapefile lives: `data/week4/D17-California/SJER/vector_data/`
2. The name of the shapefile (without the extension): `SJER_plot_centroids`

Let's import our AOI.


```r
# Import a polygon shapefile: readOGR("path","fileName")
# no extension needed as readOGR only imports shapefiles

sjer_plot_locations <- readOGR("data/week4/california/SJER/vector_data/",
                      layer="SJER_plot_centroids")
## OGR data source with driver: ESRI Shapefile 
## Source: "data/week4/california/SJER/vector_data/", layer: "SJER_plot_centroids"
## with 18 features
## It has 5 fields
```

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip:** The acronym, OGR, refers to the
OpenGIS Simple Features Reference Implementation.

{: .notice}

## Shapefile Metadata & Attributes

When we import the `SJER_plot_centroids` shapefile layer into `R` the `readOGR()` function automatically stores
information about the data. We are particularly interested in the geospatial
**metadata**, describing the format, `CRS`, `extent`, and other components of
the vector data, and the **attributes** which describe properties associated
with each individual vector object.

 <i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip:** The
 [Shapefile Metadata & Attributes in R](http://www.neondataskills.org/R/shapefile-attributes-in-R/)
tutorial provides more information on both metadata and attributes
and using attributes to subset and plot data.
{: .notice}

## Spatial Metadata
Key metadata for all shapefiles include:

1. **Object Type:** the class of the imported object.
2. **Coordinate Reference System (CRS):** the projection of the data.
3. **Extent:** the spatial extent (geographic area that the shapefile covers) of
the shapefile. Note that the spatial extent for a shapefile represents the
extent for ALL spatial objects in the shapefile.

We can view shapefile metadata using the `class`, `crs` and `extent` methods:


```r
# view just the class for the shapefile
class(sjer_plot_locations)
## [1] "SpatialPointsDataFrame"
## attr(,"package")
## [1] "sp"

# view just the crs for the shapefile
crs(sjer_plot_locations)
## CRS arguments:
##  +proj=utm +zone=11 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs +ellps=WGS84
## +towgs84=0,0,0

# view just the extent for the shapefile
extent(sjer_plot_locations)
## class       : Extent 
## xmin        : 254738.6 
## xmax        : 258497.1 
## ymin        : 4107527 
## ymax        : 4112168

# view all metadata at same time
sjer_plot_locations
## class       : SpatialPointsDataFrame 
## features    : 18 
## extent      : 254738.6, 258497.1, 4107527, 4112168  (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)
## coord. ref. : +proj=utm +zone=11 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs +ellps=WGS84 +towgs84=0,0,0 
## variables   : 5
## names       :  Plot_ID,  Point, northing,  easting, plot_type 
## min values  : SJER1068, center,  4107527, 254738.6,     grass 
## max values  :  SJER952, center,  4112168, 258497.1,     trees
```

Our `sjer_plot_locations` object is a polygon of class `SpatialPointsDataFrame`,
in the CRS **UTM zone 18N**. The CRS is critical to interpreting the object
`extent` values as it specifies units.

## Spatial Data Attributes
Each object in a shapefile has one or more attributes associated with it.
Shapefile attributes are similar to fields or columns in a spreadsheet. Each row
in the spreadsheet has a set of columns associated with it that describe the row
element. In the case of a shapefile, each row represents a spatial object - for
example, a road, represented as a line in a line shapefile, will have one "row"
of attributes associated with it. These attributes can include different types
of information that describe objects stored within a shapefile. Thus, our road,
may have a name, length, number of lanes, speed limit, type of road and other
attributes stored with it.

    Attribute data are stored in a separate *.dbf file. "></a>

    in the spatial object.

</figure>


We view the attributes of a `SpatialPointsDataFrame` using `objectName@data`
(e.g., `sjer_plot_locations@data`).


```r
# alternate way to view attributes
sjer_plot_locations@data
##     Plot_ID  Point northing  easting plot_type
## 1  SJER1068 center  4111568 255852.4     trees
## 2   SJER112 center  4111299 257407.0     trees
## 3   SJER116 center  4110820 256838.8     grass
## 4   SJER117 center  4108752 256176.9     trees
## 5   SJER120 center  4110476 255968.4     grass
## 6   SJER128 center  4111389 257078.9     trees
## 7   SJER192 center  4111071 256683.4     grass
## 8   SJER272 center  4112168 256717.5     trees
## 9  SJER2796 center  4111534 256034.4      soil
## 10 SJER3239 center  4109857 258497.1      soil
## 11   SJER36 center  4110162 258277.8     trees
## 12  SJER361 center  4107527 256961.8     grass
## 13   SJER37 center  4107579 256148.2     trees
## 14    SJER4 center  4109767 257228.3     trees
## 15    SJER8 center  4110249 254738.6     trees
## 16  SJER824 center  4110048 256185.6      soil
## 17  SJER916 center  4109617 257460.5      soil
## 18  SJER952 center  4110759 255871.2     grass
```

In this case, our polygon object only has one attribute: `id`.

## Metadata & Attribute Summary
We can view a metadata & attribute summary of each shapefile by entering
the name of the `R` object in the console. Note that the metadata output
includes the **class**, the number of **features**, the **extent**, and the
**coordinate reference system** (`crs`) of the `R` object. The last two lines of
`summary` show a preview of the `R` object **attributes**.


```r

# Plot a Shapefile
Next, let's visualize the data in our `R` `spatialpointsdataframe` object using
`plot()`.


```r
# create a plot of the shapefile
# 'pch' sets the symbol
# 'col' sets point symbol color
plot(sjer_plot_locations, col="blue",
     pch=8,
     main="SJER Plot Locations\nMadera County, CA")
```

## <i class="fa fa-pencil-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> Optional challenge: Import Line & Polygon Shapefiles

Using the steps above, import the `data/week4/california/madera-county-roads/tl_2013_06039_roads`
and `data/week4/california/SJER/vector_data/SJER_crop.shp` shapefiles into
`R`. Call the roads object `sjer_roads` and the crop layer
`sjer_crop_extent`.

Answer the following questions:

1. What type of `R` spatial object is created when you import each layer?
2. What is the `CRS` and `extent` for each object?
3. Do the files contain, points, lines or polygons?
4. How many spatial objects are in each file?
</div>



## Plot Multiple Shapefiles
The `plot()` function can be used to plot spatial objects. Use the following
arguments to add a title to your plot and to layer several spatial objects
on top of each other in your plot.

* `add = TRUE`: overlay a shapefile or raster on top the existing plot. This argument mimics layers in a typical GIS application like QGIS.
* `main=""`: add a title to the plot. To add a line break to your title, use `\n` where the line break should occur.


```r
# Plot multiple shapefiles
plot(sjer_crop_extent, col = "lightgreen",
     main="NEON Harvard Forest\nField Site")
plot(sjer_roads, add = TRUE)

# Use the pch element to adjust the symbology of the points
plot(sjer_plot_locations,
  add  = TRUE,
  pch = 19,
  col = "purple")
```
