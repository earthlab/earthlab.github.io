## One Dataset - Many Files

While text files often are self contained (one CSV) is composed of one unique file,
many spatial formats are composed of several files. A shapefile is created by
3 or more files, all of which must retain the same NAME and be
stored in the same file directory, in order for you to be able to work with them.

### Shapefile Structure

There are 3 key files associated with any and all shapefiles:

* **`.shp`:** the file that contains the geometry for all features.
* **`.shx`:** the file that indexes the geometry.
* **`.dbf`:** the file that stores feature attributes in a tabular format.

These files need to have the **same name** and to be stored in the same
directory (folder) to open properly in a GIS, `R` or `Python` tool.

Sometimes, a shapefile will have other associated files including:

* `.prj`: the file that contains information on projection format including
the coordinate system and projection information. It is a plain text file
describing the projection using well-known text (WKT) format.
* `.sbn` and `.sbx`: the files that are a spatial index of the features.
* `.shp.xml`: the file that is the geospatial metadata in XML format, (e.g.
ISO 19115 or XML format).

## Data Management - Sharing Shapefiles

When you work with a shapefile, you must keep all of the key associated
file types together. And when you share a shapefile with a colleague, it is
important to zip up all of these files into one package before you send it to
them!
