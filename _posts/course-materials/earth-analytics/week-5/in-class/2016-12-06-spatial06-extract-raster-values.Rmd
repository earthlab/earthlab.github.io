## Import Canopy Height Model

First, we will import a canopy height model created by the NEON project. In the
previous lessons / weeks we learned how to make a canopy height model by
subtracting the Digital elevation model (DEM) from the Digital surface model (DSM).

```{r import-chm, fig.cap="Histogram of CHM values"}
# import canopy height model (CHM).
SJER_chm <- raster("data/week5/california/SJER/2013/lidar/SJER_lidarCHM.tif")
SJER_chm

# plot the data
hist(SJER_chm,
     main="Histogram of Canopy Height\n NEON SJER Field Site",
     col="springgreen",
     xlab="Height (m)")

```


There are a lot of values in our CHM that == 0. Let's set those to `NA` and plot
again.

```{r view-histogram-na-0, fig.cap="histogram of chm values"}

# set values of 0 to NA as these are not trees
SJER_chm[SJER_chm==0] <- NA

# plot the modified data
hist(SJER_chm,
     main="Histogram of Canopy Height\n pixels==0 set to NA",
     col="springgreen",
     xlab="Height (m)")

```

## Part 2. Does our CHM data compare to field measured tree heights?

We now have a canopy height model for our study area in California. However, how
do the height values extracted from the CHM compare to our laboriously collected,
field measured canopy height data? To figure this out, we will use *in situ* collected
tree height data, measured within circular plots across our study area. We will compare
the maximum measured tree height value to the maximum LiDAR derived height value
for each circular plot using regression.

For this activity, we will use the a `csv` (comma separate value) file,
located in `SJER/2013/insitu/veg_structure/D17_2013_SJER_vegStr.csv`.

```{r read-plot-data, fig.cap="canopy height model / plot locations plot" }
# import plot centroids
SJER_plots <- readOGR("data/week5/california/SJER/vector_data",
                      "SJER_plot_centroids")

# Overlay the centroid points and the stem locations on the CHM plot
plot(SJER_chm,
     main="SJER  Plot Locations",
     col=gray.colors(100, start=.3, end=.9))

# pch 0 = square
plot(SJER_plots,
     pch = 16,
     cex = 2,
     col = 2,
     add=TRUE)

```

### Extract CMH data within 20 m radius of each plot centroid.

Next, we will create a boundary region (called a buffer) representing the spatial
extent of each plot (where trees were measured). We will then extract all CHM pixels
that fall within the plot boundary to use to estimate tree height for that plot.

There are a few ways to go about this task. If our plots are circular, then we can
use the `extract()` function.

    radius around an x,y point location. Values for all pixels in the specified
    raster that fall within the circular buffer are extracted. In this case, we
    will tell R to extract the maximum value of all pixels using the fun=max
    command. Source: Colin Williams, NEON

### Extract Plot Data Using Circle: 20m Radius Plots

```{r extract-plot-data }
# Insitu sampling took place within 40m x 40m square plots, so we use a 20m radius.
# Note that below will return a data.frame containing the max height
# calculated from all pixels in the buffer for each plot
SJER_height <- extract(SJER_chm,
                    SJER_plots,
                    buffer = 20, # specify a 20 m radius
                    fun=mean, # extract the MEAN value from each plot
                    sp=TRUE, # create spatial object
                    stringsAsFactors=FALSE)

```

#### Explore The Data Distribution

If you want to explore the data distribution of pixel height values in each plot,
you could remove the `fun` call to max and generate a list.
`cent_ovrList <- extract(chm,centroid_sp,buffer = 20)`. It's good to look at the
distribution of values we've extracted for each plot. Then you could generate a
histogram for each plot `hist(cent_ovrList[[2]])`. If we wanted, we could loop
through several plots and create histograms using a `for loop`.

```{r explore-data-distribution, eval=FALSE }
# cent_ovrList <- extract(chm,centroid_sp,buffer = 20)
# create histograms for the first 5 plots of data
# for (i in 1:5) {
#  hist(cent_ovrList[[i]], main=(paste("plot",i)))
#  }

```

## Extract descriptive stats from *In situ* Data
In our final step, we will extract summary height values from our field data.
We will use the `dplyr` library to do this efficiently.

First let's see how many plots are in our tree height data. Note that our tree
height data is stored in csv format.

```{r unique-plots }
# import the centroid data and the vegetation structure data
SJER_insitu <- read.csv("data/week5/california/SJER/2013/insitu/veg_structure/D17_2013_SJER_vegStr.csv",
                        stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# get list of unique plots
unique(SJER_plots$Plot_ID)

```

## Extract Max Tree Height

Next, we can use dplyr to extract a summary tree height value for each plot. In
this case, we will calculate the mean MEASURED tree height value for each
plot. This value represents the average tree in each plot. We will also calculate
the max height representing the max height for each plot.

FInally, we will compare the mean measured tree height per plot to the mean
tree height extracted from the lidar CHM.

```{r analyze-plot-dplyr }
# find the max and mean stem height for each plot
insitu_stem_height <- SJER_insitu %>%
  group_by(plotid) %>%
  summarise(insitu_max = max(stemheight), insitu_avg = mean(stemheight))

# view the data frame to make sure we're happy with the column names.
head(insitu_stem_height)

```


### Merge InSitu Data With Spatial data.frame

Once we have our summarized insitu data, we can `merge` it into the centroids
`data.frame`. Merge requires two data.frames and the names of the columns
containing the unique ID that we will merge the data on. In this case, we will
merge the data on the plot_id column. Notice that it's spelled slightly differently
in both data.frames so we'll need to tell R what it's called in each data.frame.

```{r merge-dataframe}
# merge the insitu data into the centroids data.frame
SJER_height <- merge(SJER_height,
                     insitu_stem_height,
                   by.x = 'Plot_ID',
                   by.y = 'plotid')

SJER_height@data

```

## Plot by height

```{r create-spatial-plot, fig.cap="Plots sized by vegetation height"}
# plot canopy height model
plot(SJER_chm,
     main="Vegetation Plots \nSymbol size by Average Tree Height",
     legend=F)

# add plot location sized by tree height
plot(SJER_height,
     pch=19,
     cex=(SJER_height$SJER_lidarCHM)/10, # size symbols according to tree height attribute normalized by 10
     add=T)

# place legend outside of the plot
par(xpd=T)
legend(SJER_chm@extent@xmax+250,
       SJER_chm@extent@ymax,
       legend="plot location \nsized by \ntree height",
       pch=19,
       bty='n')

```


### Plot Data (CHM vs Measured)
Let's create a plot that illustrates the relationship between in situ measured
max canopy height values and lidar derived max canopy height values.


```{r plot-w-ggplot, fig.cap="ggplot - measured vs lidar chm."}
# create plot
ggplot(SJER_height@data, aes(x=SJER_lidarCHM, y = insitu_avg)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_bw() +
  ylab("Mean measured height") +
  xlab("Mean LiDAR pixel") +
  ggtitle("Lidar Derived Mean Tree Height \nvs. InSitu Measured Mean Tree Height (m)")

```

Next, let's fix the plot adding a 1:1 line and making the x and y axis the same .

```{r plot-w-ggplot2, fig.cap="ggplot - measured vs lidar chm w one to one line."}
# create plot
ggplot(SJER_height@data, aes(x=SJER_lidarCHM, y = insitu_avg)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_bw() +
  ylab("Mean measured height") +
  xlab("Mean LiDAR pixel") +
  xlim(0,15) + ylim(0,15) + # set x and y limits to 0-20
  geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope=1) + # add one to one line
  ggtitle("Lidar Derived Tree Height \nvs. InSitu Measured Tree Height")

```

We can also add a regression fit to our plot. Explore the GGPLOT options and
customize your plot.

```{r ggplot-data, fig.cap="Scatterplot measured height compared to lidar chm."}
# plot with regression fit
p <- ggplot(SJER_height@data, aes(x=SJER_lidarCHM, y = insitu_avg)) +
  geom_point() +
  ylab("Maximum Measured Height") +
  xlab("Maximum LiDAR Height")+
    xlim(0,15) + ylim(0,15) + # set x and y limits to 0-20
  geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope=1)+
  geom_smooth(method=lm)

p + theme(panel.background = element_rect(colour = "grey")) +
  ggtitle("LiDAR CHM Derived vs Measured Tree Height") +
  theme(plot.title=element_text(family="sans", face="bold", size=20, vjust=1.9)) +
  theme(axis.title.y = element_text(family="sans", face="bold", size=14, angle=90, hjust=0.54, vjust=1)) +
  theme(axis.title.x = element_text(family="sans", face="bold", size=14, angle=00, hjust=0.54, vjust=-.2))

```


## View Difference: lidar vs measured

```{r view-diff, fig.cap="box plot showing differences between chm and measured heights."}
# Calculate difference
SJER_height@data$ht_diff <-  (SJER_height@data$SJER_lidarCHM - SJER_height@data$insitu_avg)



# create bar plot using ggplot()
ggplot(data=SJER_height@data,
       aes(x=Plot_ID, y=ht_diff, fill=Plot_ID)) +
       geom_bar(stat="identity") +
       xlab("Plot Name") + ylab("Height difference (m)")
       ggtitle("Difference: \nLidar avg height - in situ avg height (m)")

```

You have now successfully created a canopy height model using LiDAR data AND compared LiDAR
derived vegetation height, within plots, to actual measured tree height data.
Does the relationship look good or not? Would you use lidar data to estimate tree
height over larger areas? Would other metrics be a better comparison (see challenge
below).
