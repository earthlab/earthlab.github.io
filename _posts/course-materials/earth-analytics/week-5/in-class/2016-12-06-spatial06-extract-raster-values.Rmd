## Import Canopy Height Model

First, we will import the NEON canopy height model. In the previous lessons / weeks
we learned how to make this data product by subtracting the DEM from the DSM.

```{r import-chm, fig.cap="histogram of CHM values"}
# import canopy height model (CHM).
SJER_chm <- raster("data/week4//california/SJER/2013/lidar/SJER_lidarCHM.tif")
SJER_chm

# plot the data
hist(SJER_chm,
     main="Histogram of Canopy Height\n NEON SJER Field Site",
     col="springgreen",
     xlab="Height (m)")

```




```{r view-histogram-na-0, fig.cap="histogram of chm values"}

# set values of 0 to NA as these are not trees
SJER_chm[SJER_chm==0] <- NA

# plot the modified data
hist(SJER_chm,
     main="Histogram of Canopy Height\n NEON SJER Field Site, 0 values set to NA",
     col="springgreen",
     xlab="Height (m)")

```
## Part 2. How does our CHM data compare to field measured tree heights?

We now have a canopy height model for our study area in California. However, how
do the height values extracted from the CHM compare to our laboriously collected,
field measured canopy height data? To figure this out, we will use *in situ* collected
tree height data, measured within circular plots across our study area. We will compare
the maximum measured tree height value to the maximum LiDAR derived height value
for each circular plot using regression.

For this activity, we will use the a `csv` (comma separate value) file,
located in `SJER/2013/insitu/veg_structure/D17_2013_SJER_vegStr.csv`.

```{r read-plot-data, fig.cap="canopy height model / plot locations plot" }
# import plot centroids
SJER_plots <- readOGR("data/week4/california/SJER/vector_data",
                      "SJER_plot_centroids")


# Overlay the centroid points and the stem locations on the CHM plot
plot(SJER_chm,
     main="SJER  Plot Locations",
     col=gray.colors(100, start=.3, end=.9))

# pch 0 = square
plot(SJER_plots,
     pch = 16,
     cex = 2,
     col = 2,
     add=TRUE)

```

### Extract CMH data within 20 m radius of each plot centroid.

Next, we will create a boundary region (called a buffer) representing the spatial
extent of each plot (where trees were measured). We will then extract all CHM pixels
that fall within the plot boundary to use to estimate tree height for that plot.

There are a few ways to go about this task. If your plots are circular, then the
extract tool will do the job!

    <figcaption>The extract function in R allows you to specify a circular buffer
    radius around an x,y point location. Values for all pixels in the specified
    raster that fall within the circular buffer are extracted. In this case, we
    will tell R to extract the maximum value of all pixels using the fun=max
    command. Source: Colin Williams, NEON

### Extract Plot Data Using Circle: 20m Radius Plots

```{r extract-plot-data }

# Insitu sampling took place within 40m x 40m square plots, so we use a 20m radius.
# Note that below will return a dataframe containing the max height
# calculated from all pixels in the buffer for each plot
SJER_height <- extract(SJER_chm,
                    SJER_plots,
                    buffer = 20, # specify a 20 m radius
                    fun=mean, # extract the MEAN value from each plot
                    sp=TRUE, # create spatial object
                    stringsAsFactors=FALSE)

```

#### Explore The Data Distribution

If you want to explore the data distribution of pixel height values in each plot,
you could remove the `fun` call to max and generate a list.
`cent_ovrList <- extract(chm,centroid_sp,buffer = 20)`. It's good to look at the
distribution of values we've extracted for each plot. Then you could generate a
histogram for each plot `hist(cent_ovrList[[2]])`. If we wanted, we could loop
through several plots and create histograms using a `for loop`.

```{r explore-data-distribution, eval=FALSE }

# cent_ovrList <- extract(chm,centroid_sp,buffer = 20)
# create histograms for the first 5 plots of data
# for (i in 1:5) {
#  hist(cent_ovrList[[i]], main=(paste("plot",i)))
#  }

```



### Variation 3: Derive Square Plot boundaries, then CHM values around a point

## Extract descriptive stats from *In situ* Data
In our final step, we will extract summary height values from our field data.
We will use the `dplyr` library to do this efficiently. We'll demonstrate both below

### Extract stats from our spatial `data.frame` using the `DPLYR` package.

First let's see how many plots are in the centroid folder.

```{r unique-plots }

# import the centroid data and the vegetation structure data
SJER_insitu <- read.csv("data/week4/california/SJER/2013/insitu/veg_structure/D17_2013_SJER_vegStr.csv",
                        stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# get list of unique plots
unique(SJER_plots$Plot_ID)

```

## Extract Max Tree Height

Next, find the maximum MEASURED tree height value for each plot. This value represents
the tallest tree in each plot. We will compare
this value to the max lidar CHM value.

```{r analyze-plot-dplyr }

# find the max and averagestem height for each plot
insitu_stem_height <- SJER_insitu %>%
  group_by(plotid) %>%
  summarise(insitu_max = max(stemheight), insitu_avg = mean(stemheight))

head(insitu_stem_height)

# let's create better, self documenting column headers
names(insitu_stem_height) <- c("plotid", "insituMaxHt")
head(insitu_stem_height)

```


### Merge InSitu Data With Spatial data.frame

Once we have our summarized insitu data, we can `merge` it into the centroids
`data.frame`. Merge requires two data.frames and the names of the columns
containing the unique ID that we will merge the data on. In this case, we will
merge the data on the plot_id column. Notice that it's spelled slightly differently
in both data.frames so we'll need to tell R what it's called in each data.frame.

```{r merge-dataframe}

# merge the insitu data into the centroids data.frame
SJER_height <- merge(SJER_height,
                     insitu_stem_height,
                   by.x = 'Plot_ID',
                   by.y = 'plotid')

SJER_height@data

```

## plot by height

```{r create-spatial-plot, fig.cap="Plots sized by vegetation height"}
# plot canopy height model
plot(SJER_chm,
     main="Vegetation Plots \nSymbol size by Average Tree Height",
     legend=F)

# add plot location sized by tree height
plot(SJER_height,
     pch=19,
     cex=(SJER_height$SJER_lidarCHM)/10, # size symbols according to tree height attribute normalized by 10
     add=T)

legend('bottomright',
       legend="plot location \nsized by tree height",
       pch=19,
       bty='n')

```


### Plot Data (CHM vs Measured)
Let's create a plot that illustrates the relationship between in situ measured
max canopy height values and lidar derived max canopy height values.


```{r plot-w-ggplot, fig.cap="ggplot - measured vs lidar chm."}

# create plot
ggplot(SJER_height@data, aes(x=SJER_lidarCHM, y = insituMaxHt)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_bw() +
  ylab("Maximum measured height") +
  xlab("Maximum LiDAR pixel")+
  geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope=1) +
  ggtitle("Lidar Height Compared to InSitu Measured Height")

```


We can also add a regression fit to our plot. Explore the GGPLOT options and
customize your plot.

```{r ggplot-data, fig.cap="Scatterplot measured height compared to lidar chm."}

# plot with regression fit
p <- ggplot(SJER_height@data, aes(x=SJER_lidarCHM, y = insituMaxHt)) +
  geom_point() +
  ylab("Maximum Measured Height") +
  xlab("Maximum LiDAR Height")+
  geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope=1)+
  geom_smooth(method=lm)

p + theme(panel.background = element_rect(colour = "grey")) +
  ggtitle("LiDAR CHM Derived vs Measured Tree Height") +
  theme(plot.title=element_text(family="sans", face="bold", size=20, vjust=1.9)) +
  theme(axis.title.y = element_text(family="sans", face="bold", size=14, angle=90, hjust=0.54, vjust=1)) +
  theme(axis.title.x = element_text(family="sans", face="bold", size=14, angle=00, hjust=0.54, vjust=-.2))

```


## View Differences

```{r view-diff, fig.cap="box plot showing differences between chm and measured heights."}

SJER_height@data$ht_diff <-  (SJER_height@data$SJER_lidarCHM - SJER_height@data$insituMaxHt)

# base plot example below
# barplot(SJER_height@data$ht_diff,
#        xlab = SJER_height@data$Plot_ID)


# create bar plot using ggplot()
ggplot(data=SJER_height@data, aes(x=Plot_ID, y=ht_diff, fill=Plot_ID)) +
    geom_bar(stat="identity")

```

## Challenge: LiDAR vs Insitu Comparison

Create a plot of LiDAR 95th percentile value vs *insitu* max height. Or LiDAR 95th
percentile vs *insitu* 95th percentile. Add labels to your plot. Customize the
colors, fonts and the look of your plot. If you are happy with the outcome, share
your plot in the comments below!

## Create Plot.ly Interactive Plot

Plot.ly is a free to use, online interactive data viz site. If you have the
plot.ly library installed, you can quickly export a ggplot graphic into plot.ly!
 (NOTE: it also works for python matplotlib)!! To use plot.ly, you need to setup
an account. Once you've setup an account, you can get your key from the plot.ly
site (under Settings > API Keys) to make the code below work.

You must be signed into plot.ly online, from your current computer, at the time
you use the `plotly_POST` command to upload you plot to your plot.ly account.


```{r create-plotly, eval=FALSE }

library(plotly)

# you must be signed into Plot.ly online on the same computer for this code to work.
# generate the plot
ggplotly(p,
        filename='NEON SJER CHM vs Insitu Tree Height')


```
