## <i class="fa fa-graduation-cap" aria-hidden="true"></i> Learning Objectives

After completing this tutorial, you will be able to:

* Query the twitter RESTful API to access and import into R tweets that contain various text strings.
* Generate a list of users that are tweeting about a particular topic
* Use the tidytext package in R to explore and analyze word counts associated with tweets.

You will need a computer with internet access to complete this lesson.

</div>


In this lesson we will explore analyzing social media data accessed from twitter,
in R. We will use the Twitter RESTful API to access data about both twitter users
and what they are tweeting about

## Getting Started

To get started we'll need to do the following things:

1. Setup a twitter account if you don't have one already
2. Using your account, setup an application that we will use to access twitter from R
3. Download and install the `rtweet` and `tidytext` packages for R.

Once we've done these things, we are reading to begin querying Twitter's API to
see what we can learn about tweets!

## Setup Twitter App

Let's start by setting up an application in twitter that we can use to access
tweets. To setup your app, follow the documentation from `rtweet` here:

<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rtweet/vignettes/auth.html" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-info-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i>
 TUTORIAL: How to setup a twitter application using your twitter account</a>

NOTE: you will need to provide your cell phone number to twitter to verify your 
use of the API.

## Twitter in R

Once we have our twitter app setup, we are ready to dive into accessing tweets in R.

We will use the `rtweet` package to do this.

```{r setup, echo=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning=FALSE)

```

```{r load-packages}
# load twitter library - the rtweet library is recommended now over twitteR
library(rtweet)
# plotting and pipes - tidyverse!
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
# text mining library
library(tidytext)

```


```{r create-twitter-token, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# when you do this, it
twitter_token <- create_token(
  app = appname,
  consumer_key = key,
  consumer_secret = secret)

# get wd
file_name <- file.path(getwd(), "earth_analytics_twitter_token.rds")
## save token to home directory
saveRDS(twitter_token, file = file_name)
```

```{r read-token, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
# read in the rds file that allows us to access the API
# this avoids storing api info on github - rather it's on my computer locally
readRDS(file = 'earth_analytics_twitter_token.rds')
```

The first thing that we need to setup in our code is our authentication. When
you set up your app, it provides you with 3 unique identification elements:

1. appnam
2. key
3. secret

These keys are located in your  twitter app settings in the `Keys and Access
Tokens` tab. You will need to copy those into your code as i did below replacing the filler
text that i used in this lesson for the text that twitter gives you in your app.

Next, we need to pass a suite of keys to the API.

```{r app-name-example, eval=FALSE}
# whatever name you assigned to your created app
appname <- "your-app-name"

## api key (example below is not a real key)
key <- "yourLongApiKeyHere"

## api secret (example below is not a real key)
secret <- "yourSecretKeyHere"

```

Finally, we can create a token that authenticates access to tweets!
Note that the authentication process below will open a window in your browser.


```{r create-token}
# create token named "twitter_token"
twitter_token <- create_token(
  app = appname,
  consumer_key = key,
  consumer_secret = secret)

```


If authentication is successful works, it should render the following message in
a browser window:

`Authentication complete. Please close this page and return to R.`

### Send a tweet

Note that your tweet needs to be 140 characters or less.

```{r eval=FALSE }
post_tweet("Look, i'm tweeting from R in my #rstats #earthanalytics class!")
# this throws an error but then says it's posted but ofcourse doesn't post.
```

### Search twitter for tweets

Now we are ready to search twitter for recent tweets! Let's start by finding all
tweets that use the `#rstats` hashtag. Notice below we use the `rtweet::search_tweets()`
function to search. `search_tweets()` requires the following arguments:

1. q: the query word that you want to look for
2. n: the number of tweets that you want returned. You can request up to a
maximum of 18,000 tweets.

To see what other arguments you can use with this function, use the `R` help:

`?search_tweets`


```{r get-tweets }
## search for 500 tweets using the #rstats hashtag
rstats_tweets <- search_tweets(q="#rstats", 
                               n = 500)
# view the first 3 rows of the dataframe
head(rstats_tweets, n=3)
```

## Retweets

A retweet is when you or someone else shares someone elses tweet so your / their
followers can see it. It is similar to sharing in facebook where you can add a
quote or text above the retweet if you want or just share the post. Let's use
the same query that we used above but this time ignore all retweets by setting
the `include_rts` argument to `FALSE`. We can get tweet / retweet stats from
our dataframe, separately.

```{r no-retweets }
# find recent tweets with #rstats but ignore retweets
rstats_tweets <- search_tweets("#rstats", n = 500,
                             include_rts = FALSE)
head(rstats_tweets, n=2)

```

Next, let's figure out who is tweeting about `R` / using the `#rstats` hashtag.

```{r view-screennames}
# view column with screen names
head(rstats_tweets$screen_name)
# get a list of just the unique usernames
unique(rstats_tweets$screen_name)

```

We can similarly use the `search_users()` function to just see what users are tweeting
using a particular hashtag. This function returns just a data.frame of the users
and information about their accounts.

```{r find-users }
# what users are tweeting with #rstats
users <- search_users("#rstats", 
                      n=500)
# just view the first 2 users - the data frame is large!
head(users, n=2)

```

Let's learn a bit more about these people tweeting about `R`. First, where are
they from?

```{r explore-users, fig.cap="plot of users tweeting about R" }
# how many locations are represented
length(unique(users$location))

users %>%
  ggplot(aes(location)) +
  geom_bar() + coord_flip() +
      labs(x="Count",
      y="Location",
      title="Twitter users - unique locations ")
```

Let's sort by count and just plot the top locations. To do this we use top_n(). 
Note that in this case we are grouping our data by user. Thus top_n() will return
locations with atleast 15 users associated with it. 

```{r users-tweeting, fig.cap="top 15 locations where people are tweeting"}
users %>%
  count(location, sort=TRUE) %>%
  mutate(location= reorder(location,n)) %>%
  top_n(20) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=location,y=n)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip() +
      labs(x="Count",
      y="Location",
      title="Twitter users - unique locations ")
```

It looks like we have some `NA` or no data values in our list. Let's remove those 
with `na.omit()`.

```{r users-tweeting2, fig.cap="top 15 locations where people are tweeting - na removed"}
users %>%
  count(location, sort=TRUE) %>%
  mutate(location= reorder(location,n)) %>%
  na.omit() %>% 
  top_n(20) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=location,y=n)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip() +
      labs(x="Location",
      y="Count",
      title="Twitter users - unique locations ")
```

Looking at our data, what do you notice that might improve this plot?
There are 314 unique locations in our list. However, everyone didn't specify their
locations using the approach. For example some just identified their country:
United States for example and others specified a city and state. We may want to
do some cleaning of these data to be able to better plot this distribution - especially
if we want to create a map of these data! 

### Users by time zone

Lets have a look at the time zone field next.


```{r clean-data, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE, fig.cap="plot of users by time zone cleaned up." }
users %>% na.omit() %>%
  ggplot(aes(time_zone)) +
  geom_bar() + coord_flip() +
      labs(x="Count",
      y="Time Zone",
      title="Twitter users - unique time zones ")
```

<div class="notice--warning" markdown="1">

## <i class="fa fa-pencil-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> Optional challenge

Use the example above, plot users by time zone. List time zones that have atleast 
20 users associated with them. What do you notice about the data?
</div>

```{r plot-timezone-cleaned, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="plot of users by location" }
users %>%
  count(time_zone, sort=TRUE) %>%
  mutate(location= reorder(time_zone,n)) %>%
  top_n(20) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=location,y=n)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip() +
      labs(y="Count",
      x="Time Zone",
      title="Twitter users - unique time zones ")
```




The plots above aren't perfect. What do you start to notice about working
with these data? Can we simply download them and plot the data?

## Data munging  101

When we work with data from sources like NASA, USGS, etc there are particular
cleaning steps that we often need to do. For instance:

* we may need to remove nodata values
* we may need to scale the data
* and others

In the next lesson we will dive deeper into the art of "text-mining" to extract
information about a particular topic from twitter.
