## About the Course
This advanced, multidisciplinary course will address major questions in Earth
science and teach students to use the analytical tools necessary to undertake
exploration of ‘big scientific data’. This course is designed for upper level (junior /
senior level) undergraduate students and graduate students.

Throughout the course we will use computationally intensive techniques to address
scientific questionsWe will use a suite of different
types of publicly available data including:

* Satellite and airborne lidar and spectral remote sensing data,
* Data collected using distributed *in situ* (on the ground) sensor networks
* Social media data, and
* Demographic (census) data.

## Learning Outcomes

At the end of this course you will be able to:

* Open and visualize various types of data using the `R` programming language.
* Navigate and use the `RStudio` environment for `R`.
* Describe and apply several approaches to efficient computing including parallelization.

## Grading
Grading will be based on the following course assignments. Late assignments will
receive a 10% deduction per 24-hour period after the due date/time.

| Assignment  | Percent of Credit   |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Exercises | 25% |
| Mid Term Presentation | 20% |
| Final Group Presentation | 20% |
| Final Project Submission | 20%  |
| Class Participation | 15% |

## Late assignments

Late assignments will not be accepted in this course. If there are extenuating /
university approved
circumstances university-approved activity, illness, injury, family emergency, or religious
observance that prevents you from completing an assignment on time, please
get in touch with the instructor or the course TA as soon as possible.


## Attendance

Attendance is required for all class sessions. In the event that you must miss a class due
to a university-approved activity, illness, injury, family emergency, or religious
observance, you must notify the course instructor, preferably **before** the day of class, and the absence
will be excused. Students will be given a reasonable amount of time to make up the
work based on the type of assignment missed and the reason for their absence.
Unexcused absences will affect the student’s grade because regular
participation is a requirement of this course.


## Readings

Readings are posted every week along with the homework assignment for that week.
The material for each week will be posted no later than the Tuesday before the
next weeks' class. If you are looking ahead to upcoming weeks, please note that,
readings are subject to change.
