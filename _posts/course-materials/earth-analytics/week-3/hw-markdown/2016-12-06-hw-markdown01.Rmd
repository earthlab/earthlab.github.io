## Add an image to your report

You can add images to a report using markdown. The syntax is below.

```md
![alt text here](path-to-image-here)
```

Good file management becomes extremely important when you are dealing with images.
Setup an images directory in your working directory. And call each images from that
directory as follows:

```md
![an image caption Source: Ultimate Funny Dog Videos Compilation 2013.](images/week3/silly-dog.png)
```
And here's what that code does IF the image is in the right place:

![an image caption Source: Ultimate Funny Dog Videos Compilation 2013.](images/week3/silly-dog.png)

That way when you knit, `knitr` will be able to find the images.

My directory is setup as follows:
