### Reclassification vs. breaks

In this lesson, we will learn how to reclassify a raster dataset in `R`. Previously,
we plotted a raster value using break points - that is to say, we colored particular
ranges of raster pixels using a defined set of values that we call `breaks`.
In this lesson, we will learn how to reclassify a raster. When you reclassify
a raster, you
create a **new** raster
object / file that can be exported and shared with colleagues and / or open in other tools such
as QGIS.

<figcaption>When you reclassify a raster, you create a new raster. In that raster, each cell from the old raster is mapped to the new raster. The values in the new raster are applied using a defined range of values or a raster map. For example above you can see that all cells that
contains the values 1-3 are assigned the new value of 5. Image source: ESRI.

## Load libraries

```{r setup, echo=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning=FALSE)
```

```{r load-libraries}
# load the raster and rgdal libraries
library(raster)
library(rgdal)
```

## Raster classification steps

We can break our raster processing workflow into several steps as follows:

* **Data import / cleanup:** load and "clean" the data. This may include cropping, dealing with NA values, etc
* **Data Exploration:** understand the range and distribution of values in your data. This may involve plotting histograms scatter plots, etc
* **More Data Processing & Analysis:** This may include the final data processing steps that you determined based upon the data exploration phase.
* **Final Data Analysis:** The final steps of your analysis - often performed using information gathered in the early data processing / exploration stages of your workflow.
* **Presentation:** Refining your results into a final plot or set of plots that are cleaned up, labeled, etc.

Please note - working with data is not a linear process. There are no defined
steps. As you work with data more, you will develop your own workflow and approach.

To get started, let's first open up our raster. In this case we are using the lidar 
canopy height model (CHM) that we calculated in the previous lesson.

```{r open-raster}
# open canopy height model
lidar_chm <- raster("data/week3/BLDR_LeeHill/outputs/lidar_chm.tif")
```

### What classification values to use?

We want to classify our raster into 3 classes:
  
* Short 
* Medium
* Tall  

However what valuerepresents a tall vs a short tree? We need to better 
understand our data before assigning classification values to it. Let's begin 
by looking at the min and max values in our CHM.

```{r view-sum-stats}
summary(lidar_chm)
```

Looking at the summary above, it appears as if we have a range of values from 
`r lidar_chm@data@min` to `r lidar_chm@data@max`. 

Let's explore the data further by looking at a histogram. A histogram quantifies
the distribution of values found in our data.   

```{r plot-histogram, fig.cap="histogram of lidar chm data"}
# plot histogram of data
hist(lidar_chm,
     main="Distribution of raster cell values in the DTM difference data",
     xlab="Height (m)", ylab="Number of Pixels",
     col="springgreen")

```

We can further explore our histogram, by constraining the x axis limits using the 
`lims` argument. The lims argument visually 
zooms in on the data in the plot. It does not modify the data!

```{r hist-contrained, fig.cap="plot of chm histogram constrained above 0"}
# zoom in on x and y axis
hist(lidar_chm,
     xlim=c(2,25),
     ylim=c(0,4000),
     main="Histogram of canopy height model differences \nZoomed in to -2 to 2 on the x axis",
     col="springgreen")

```

We can look at the values that r used to draw our histogram too. To do this, we assign
our hist() function to a new variable. Then we look at the variable contents. This 
shows us the breaks used to bin our histogram data.



```{r view-hist-info}
# see how R is breaking up the data
histinfo <- hist(lidar_chm)
histinfo
```

Each bin represents a bar on our histogram plot. Each bar represents the frequency
or number of pixels that have a value within that bin. For instance, there 
is a break between 0 and 1 in the histogram results above. And there are 76,057 pixels
in the counts element that fall into that bin. 

```{r view-hist-stats}
histinfo$counts
histinfo$breaks
```

If we want to customize our histogram further, we can customize the number of 
breaks that R uses to create it. 

```{r}
# zoom in on x and y axis
hist(lidar_chm,
     xlim=c(2,25),
     ylim=c(0,1000),
     breaks=100,
     main="Histogram of canopy height model differences \nZoomed in to -2 to 2 on the x axis",
     col="springgreen",
     xlab="Pixel value")
```

Notice that i've adjusted the x and y lims to zoom into the region of the histogram
that I am interested in exploring.

### Histogram with custom breaks

We can create custom breaks or bins in a histogram too. To do this, we pass the 
same breaks argument a vector of numbers that represent the range for each bin 
in our histogram.

By using custom breaks, we can explore how our data may look when we classify it. 

```{r histogram-breaks, fig.cap="histogram with custom breaks"}
# We may want to explore breaks in our histogram before plotting our data
hist(lidar_chm,
     breaks=c(0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30),
     main="Histogram with custom breaks",
     xlab="Height (m)" , ylab="Number of Pixels",
     col="springgreen")

```

We may want to play with the distribution of breaks. Below it appears as if 
there are many values close to 0. In the case of this lidar instrument we know that 
values between 0 and 2 meters are not reliable (we know this if we read the documentation
about the NEON sensor and how these data were processed). Let's create a bin between 0-2.

We know we want to create bins for short, medium and tall trees so let's experiment 
with those bins also. 

Below i use the following breaks:

* 0 - 2 = no trees
* 2-4 = short trees
* 4 - 7 = medium trees
* `>` 7 = tall trees


```{r histogram-breaks2, fig.cap="histogram with custom breaks"}
# We may want to explore breaks in our histogram before plotting our data
hist(lidar_chm,
     breaks=c(0, 2, 4, 7, 30),
     main="Histogram with custom breaks",
     xlab="Height (m)" , ylab="Number of Pixels",
     col="springgreen")

```

You may want to play around with the classes further. Or you may have a scientific 
reason to select particular classes. Regardless, let's use the classes above to 
reclassify our CHM raster. 

## Map raster values to new values

To reclassify our raster, first we need to create a reclassification matrix. This
matrix MAPS a range of values to a new defined value. Let's create a classified
canopy height model where we designate short, medium and tall trees.

The newly defined values will be as follows:

* No trees: (0m - 2m tall) = NA
* Short trees: (2m - 4m tall) = 1
* Medium trees: (4m - 7m tall) = 2
* Tall trees:  (> 7m tall) = 3

Notice in the list above that we set cells with a value between 0 and 2 meters to 
NA or no data value. This means we are assuming that thereare no trees in those 
locations! 

Notice in the matrix below that we use `Inf` to represent the largest or max value
found in the raster. So our assignment is as follows:

* 0 - 2 meters -> NA
* 2 - 4 meters -> 1 (short trees)
* 4-7 meters -> 2 (medium trees)
* `>` 7 or 7 - Inf -> 3 (tall trees)  

Let's create the matrix!

```{r create-reclass }
# create classification matrix
reclass_df <- c(0, 2, NA,
              2, 4, 1,
             4, 7, 2,
             7, Inf, 3)
reclass_df
```

Next, we reshape our list of numbers below into a matrix with rows and columns.
The matrix data format supports numeric data and can be one or more dimensions. 
Our matrix below is similar to a spreadsheet with rows and columns. 

```{r create-matrix}
# reshape the object into a matrix with columns and rows
reclass_m <- matrix(reclass_df,
                ncol=3,
                byrow=TRUE)
reclass_m

```

## Reclassify raster

Once we have created our classification matrix, we can reclassify our CHM raster
using the `reclassify()` function. 

```{r reclassify-raster, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# reclassify the raster using the reclass object - reclass_m
chm_classified <- reclassify(lidar_chm,
                     reclass_m)

```

We can view the distribution of pixels assigned to each class using the barplot().
Note that I am not using the histogram function in this case given we only have 3 classes! 
```{r}
# view reclassified data
barplot(chm_classified,
        main="Number of pixels in each class")
```

If the raster classification output has values or 0, we can set those to NA using 
the syntax below. The left side of this syntax tells R to first select ALL pixels 
in the raster where 
the pixel value = 0. `chm_classified[chm_classified == 0]`. Notice the use of two equal
signs `==` in this statement. 

The right side of the code says "assign to NA" `<- NA` 

```{r}
# assign all pixels that equal 0 to NA or no data value
chm_classified[chm_classified==0] <- NA
```

Then, finally we can plot our raster. Notice the colors that I selected are not ideal!
You can pick better colors for your plot. 

```{r reclassify-plot-raster, fig.cap="classified chm plot"}
# plot reclassified data
plot(chm_classified,
     col=c("red", "blue", "green"))

```

## Add custom legend

Our plot looks OK but the legend doesn't represent the data well. The legend is 
continuous - with a range between 0 and 3. However we want to plot the data using 
discrete bins. 

Finally, let's clean up our plot legend. Given we have discrete values we will
create a CUSTOM legend with the 3 categories that we created in our classification matrix.


```{r plot-w-legend, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.cap="classified chm with legend."}
# plot reclassified data
plot(chm_classified,
     legend=F,
     col=c("red", "blue", "green"), axes=F,
     main="Classified Canopy Height Model \n short, medium, tall trees")

legend("topright",
       legend = c("short trees", "medium trees", "tall trees"),
       fill = c("red", "blue", "green"),
       border = F,
       bty="n") # turn off legend border

```

Finally, let's create a color object so we don't have to type out the colors twice.
 
```{r plot-w-legend-colors, fig.cap="classified chm with legend."}
# create color object with nice new colors!
chm_colors <- c("palegoldenrod", "palegreen2", "palegreen4")

# plot reclassified data
plot(chm_classified,
     legend=F,
     col=chm_colors,
     axes=F,
     main="Classified Canopy Height Model \n short, medium, tall trees")

legend("topright",
       legend = c("short trees", "medium trees", "tall trees"),
       fill = chm_colors,
       border = F,
       bty="n") 
```

Finally, we may want to remove the box from our plot.

```{r plot-w-legend-colors2, fig.cap="classified chm with legend."}
# create color object with nice new colors!
chm_colors <- c("palegoldenrod", "palegreen2", "palegreen4")

# plot reclassified data
plot(chm_classified,
     legend=F,
     col=chm_colors,
     axes=F,
     box=F,
     main="Classified Canopy Height Model \n short, medium, tall trees")

legend("topright",
       legend = c("short trees", "medium trees", "tall trees"),
       fill = chm_colors,
       border = F,
       bty="n") 
```

## <i class="fa fa-pencil-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> Optional challenge - plot change over time

1. Create a classified raster map that shows **positive and negative change** in the canopy height model before and after the flood. To do this you will need to calculate the difference
between two canopy height models.
2. Create a classified raster map that shows **positive and negative change** in terrain extracted from the pre and post flood Digital Terrain Models
before and after the flood.

For each plot, be sure to:

* Add a legend that clearly shows what each color in your classified raster represents
* Use better colors that I used in my example above!.
* Add a title to your plot.

You will include these plots in your final report due next week.
