## <i class="fa fa-graduation-cap" aria-hidden="true"></i> Learning Objectives

After completing this tutorial, you will be able to:

* Reclassify a raster dataset in R using a set of defined values.

## <i class="fa fa-check-square-o fa-2" aria-hidden="true"></i> What you need

You need `R` and `RStudio` to complete this tutorial. Also you should have
an `earth-analytics` directory setup on your computer with a `/data`
directory with it.

* [How to Setup R / RStudio](/course-materials/earth-analytics/week-1/setup-r-rstudio/)
* [Setup your working directory](/course-materials/earth-analytics/week-1/setup-working-directory/)
* [Intro to the R & RStudio Interface](/course-materials/earth-analytics/week-1/intro-to-r-and-rstudio)

### R Libraries to Install:

* **raster:** `install.packages("raster")`
* **rgdal:** `install.packages("rgdal")`

In this lesson, we will learn how to reclassify a raster dataset in `R`. Previously,
we plotted a raster value using break points - that is to say, we colored particular
ranges of raster values using a defined set of values that we call `breaks`.
In this lesson, we will learn how to reclassify a raster - to create a new raster
object / file that we can share with colleagues and / or open in other tools such
as QGIS.

<figcaption>When you reclassify a raster. You assign each cell a discrete value
using a defined range of values. For example above you can see that all cells that
contains the values 1-3 are assigned the new value of 5. Source: ESRI.

## Load libraries

```{r load-libraries, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE }
# load the raster and rgdal libraries
library(raster)
library(rgdal)
```

## Map raster values to new values

The first thing that we will need to create is a reclassification matrix. This
matrix MAPS a range of values to a new defined value. Let's create a classified
canopy height model where we designate short, medium and tall trees.

The values will be defined as follows:

* short = 1
* medium = 2
* tall = 3

```{r create-matrix }
# create classification matrix
reclass_df <- c(0, 10, 1,
             10, 20, 2,
             20, 35, 3)
reclass_df

# reshape the object into a matrix with columns and rows
reclass_m <- matrix(reclass_df,
                ncol=3,
                byrow=TRUE)
reclass_m

```

## Reclassify raster

Next, we will reclassify the raster

```{r reclassify-raster, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.cap="classified chm plot"}
# open canopy height model
lidar_chm <- raster("data/week3/BLDR_LeeHill/outputs/lidar_chm.tif")

# reclassify the raster using the reclass object - reclass_m
chm_classified <- reclassify(lidar_chm,
                     reclass_m)
# plot reclassified data
plot(chm_classified,
     col=c("red", "blue", "green"))

```


## Add custom legend

Finally, let's clean up our plot legend. Given we have discrete values we will
create a CUSTOM legend with the 3 categories that we created in our classification matrix.


```{r plot-w-legend, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.cap="classified chm with legend."}
# plot reclassified data
plot(chm_classified,
     legend=F,
     col=c("red", "blue", "green"), axes=F,
     main="Canopy Height Model - Classified: short, medium, tall trees")

legend("topright",
       legend = c("short trees", "medium trees", "tall trees"),
       fill = c("red", "blue", "green"),
       border = F,
       bty="n") # turn off legend border

```

## <i class="fa fa-pencil-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> Challenge - plot change over time

1. Create a classified raster map that shows **positive and negative change** in the canopy height model before and after the flood. To do this you will need to calculate the difference
between two canopy height models.
2. Create a classified raster map that shows **positive and negative change** in terrain extracted from the pre and post flood Digital Terrain Models
before and after the flood.

For each plot, be sure to:

* add a legend that clearly shows what each color in your classified raster represents
* use better colors that I used in my example above!.
* add a title to your plot.

You will include these plots in your final report due next week.

Check out <a href="https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/~frazier/RSpatialGuides/colorPaletteCheatsheet.pdf" target="_blank">this cheatsheet for more on colors in `R`. </a>

Or type: `grDevices::colors()` into the r console for a nice list of colors!
