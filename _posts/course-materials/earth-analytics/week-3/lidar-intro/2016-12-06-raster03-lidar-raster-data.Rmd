In the last lesson, we learned about lidar points clouds. In this lesson, we
will learn how a point cloud is converted into a gridded or raster data format.


### How A Lidar system records points

Remember that lidar is an active remote sensing system that records reflected
or returned light energy. A discrete return lidar system, records the strongest
reflections of light as discrete or individual points. Each point has an associated
X, Y and Z value associated with it. It also has an intensity which represents
the amount of reflected light energy that returned to the sensor.

## Gridded or Raster LiDAR Data Products
Point clouds provide a lot of information, scientifically. However they can be
difficult to work with given the size of the data and tools that are available
to handle large volumns of points. LiDAR data products are often
created and stored in a gridded or raster data format. The raster format can be
easier for many people to work with and also is supported by many different
commonly used software packages.

A raster file is a composed of regular grid of cells, all of which are the same
size. You've looked at and used rasters before if you've looked at photographs
or imagery in a tool like Google Earth. However, the raster files that we will
work with are different from photographs in that they are spatially referenced.
Each pixel represents an area of land on the ground. That area is defined by
the **resolution** of the raster.

A few notes about rasters:

-  Each cell is called a pixel.
-  And each pixel represents an area on the ground.
-  The resolution of the raster represents the area that each pixel represents
the area it represents on the ground. So, a 1 meter resolution raster, means that each pixel represents  a 1 m by 1m area on the ground.

A raster dataset can have attributes associated with it as well. For instance in a
LiDAR derived digital elevation model (DEM), each cell represents an elevation
value for that location on the earth. In a LIDAR derived intensity image, each cell
represents a LIDAR intensity value or the amount of light energy returned to and
recorded by the sensor.

## Creating A Raster From LiDAR Point Clouds

There are different ways to create a raster from LiDAR point clouds. Let's look
at one of the most basic ways to create a raster file points - gridding.
When you grid raster data, you calculate a value for each pixel or cell in your
raster dataset using the points that are spatially located within that cell. To
do this:

1. A grid is placed on top of the LiDAR data in geographic space. Each cell in
the grid has the same spatial dimensions. These dimensions represent that
particular area on the ground. If we want to derive a 1 m resolution raster
from the lidar data, we overlay a 1m by 1m grid over the LiDAR data points.
2. Within each 1 m x 1 m cell, we calculate a value to be applied to that cell,
using the LiDAR points found within that cell. The simplest method of doing this
is to take the max, min or mean height value of all lidar points found within
the 1 m cell. If we use this approach, we might have cells in the raster that
don't contains any lidar points. These cells will have a "no data" value if we
process our raster in this way.

### Point to Raster Methods - Interpolation

A different approach is to interpolate the value for each cell. Interpolation
considers the values of points outside of the cell in addition to points within
the cell to calculate a value. Interpolation also often uses statistical operations
(math) to calculate the cell value. Interpolation is useful because it can provide us
with some ability to predict or calculate cell values in areas where there are
no data (or no points). And to quantify the error associated with those predictions
which is useful to know, if you are doing research.

We will not be talking about interpolation in today's class.

In the next lesson, we will learn how to open a lidar raster dataset in R.
