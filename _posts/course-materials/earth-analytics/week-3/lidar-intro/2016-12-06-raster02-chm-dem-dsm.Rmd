### Things You'll Need To Complete This Lesson

You need `R` and `RStudio` to complete this tutorial. Also you should have
an `earth-analytics` directory setup on your computer with a `/data`
directory with it.

* [How to Setup R / RStudio](/course-materials/earth-analytics/week-1/setup-r-rstudio/)
* [Setup your working directory](/course-materials/earth-analytics/week-1/setup-working-directory/)
* [Intro to the R & RStudio Interface](/course-materials/earth-analytics/week-1/intro-to-r-and-rstudio)

### R Libraries to Install:

* **ggplot2:** `install.packages("ggplot2")`
* **dplyr:** `install.packages("dplyr")`

As we discussed in the previous lesson, LiDAR or **Li**ght **D**etection **a**nd
**R**anging is an active remote sensing system that can be used to measure
vegetation height across wide areas. In this lesson, we will import and work with
several lidar derived data products in R.


## 3 Important Lidar Data Products: CHM, DEM, DSM

   <figcaption>Digital Surface Model (DSM), Digital Elevation Models (DEM) and
   the Canopy Height Model (CHM) are the most common raster format lidar
   derived data products. One way to derive a CHM is to take
   the difference between the digital surface model (DSM, tops of trees, buildings
   and other objects) and the Digital Terrain Model (DTM, ground level). The CHM
   represents the actual height of trees, buildings, etc. with the influence of
   ground elevation removed. Graphic: Colin Williams, NEON
