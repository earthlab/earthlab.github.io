Here, we break down the basic syntax for a markdown file. We also cover how to
create and format markdown (`.md`) files.

<div class="notice--warning" markdown="1">
# Learning Objectives
At the end of this activity, you will be able to:

* Use basic markdown syntax to format a document including: headers, bold and italics.
* Be able to explain what the markdown format is.

## Markdown in Rmd files

An R markdown file can contain text written using the markdown syntax.
Markdown text, can be whatever you want. It may describe the data that you are
using, how it's being processed and what the outputs are. You may even add some
text that interprets or discusses the outputs.

When you render your document to HTML, this markdown will appear as text on the
output HTML document. We will learn about the markdown syntax next.


## What is the .md Format?

Markdown is a human readable syntax for formatting text documents. Markdown can
be used to produce nicely formatted documents including
pdf's, web pages and more. Think of it like a word processing tool, like Microsoft
Word of Google Docs. In Google docs, you can make text bold and add headings that
visually break up your document. You can
do the same in markdown, however you do it using a particular format or `syntax`.

In this tutorial, we cover the basic syntax of markdown.

## Markdown Syntax

Markdown is simple plain text, that is styled using special characters, including:

* ` #`: a header element
* `**`: bold text
* `*`: italic text
* <code>` </code>: code blocks

Let's review some basic markdown syntax.

### Plain Text

Plain text will appear as paragraph text in a Markdown document. You can format
that text in different ways.

For example, if we want to highlight a function or some code within a plain text
paragraph, we can use one backtick on each side of the text ( <code>``</code> ),
like this: <code>`Here is some code`</code>. This is the backtick, or grave; not an apostrophe (on most
US keyboards it is on the same key as the tilde (~)).

To add emphasis to other text you can use **bold** or *italics*.

Have a look at the markdown below:

```
The use of the highlight ( `text` ) will be reserved for denoting code.
To add emphasis to other text use **bold** or *italics*.
```

Notice that this sentence uses both a code highlight "``", bold and italics.
As a rendered markdown chunk, it looks like this:

The use of the highlight ( `text` ) will be reserve for denoting code when
used in text. To add emphasis to other text use **bold** or *italics*.

### Horizontal Lines (rules)

Create a rule:

Below is the rule rendered:

## Section Headings

We create a heading using the pound (`#`) sign. For the headers to render
properly there must be a space between the # and the header text.
Heading one is 1 `#` sign, heading two is 2 `##` signs, etc as follows:

## Heading two
	## Heading two

### Heading three
	### Heading three

#### Heading four
	#### Heading four

editor is a powerful text editor package by GitHub, that also has a Markdown
renderer that allows you to preview the rendered Markdown as you write.

### Explore Your R Markdown File

Look closely at the pre-populated markdown and R code chunks in the `.rmd`
file that we created above.

Does any of the markdown syntax look familiar?

* Are any words in bold?
* Are any words in italics?
* Are any words highlighted as code?

If you are unsure, the answers are at the bottom of this page.

## Activity: R Markdown Text

1. Remove the template markdown and code chunks added to the RMD file by RStudio.
(Be sure to keep the YAML header!)
2. At the very top of your RMD document - after the YAML header, add
the bio and short research description that you wrote last week in markdown syntax to
the RMD file.
3. Between your profile and the research descriptions, add a header that says
**About My Project** (or something similar).
4. Add a new header XXX **XXX Activity** and text below that explaining
that this page demonstrates using some of the **XXX XXX XXX data products**
in R. The wording of this text should clearly describe the code and outputs that
you will be adding the page.
