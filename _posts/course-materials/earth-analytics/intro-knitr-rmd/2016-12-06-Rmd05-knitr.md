In the previous tutorials we've learned about the R Markdown format and how
to create a report using R Markdown in R Studio. In this tutorial, we will
render or `knit` an R Markdown document to a web friendly, `html` format using
the R `knitr` package. `knitr` can be used to convert R Markdown files to many
different formats including: `HTML`, `PDF`, github markdown (`.md`) and more.

<div class='notice--success' markdown="1">

# Learning Objectives

At the end of this activity, you will:

* Be able to produce (‘knit’) an HTML file from a R Markdown file.
* Know how to modify chuck options to change what is rendered and not rendered on the output HTML file.

## Things You’ll Need To Complete This Tutorial

You will need the most current version of R and, preferably, RStudio loaded on
your computer to complete this tutorial.

## Download Data

https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/7010681

### Install R Packages

* **knitr:** `install.packages("knitr")`
* **rmarkdown:** `install.packages("rmarkdown")`

## An Rmd File

To complete this tutorial you will need an R Markdown document that contains a
YAML header, code chunks and markdown segments.

## What Is knitr?

`knitr` is the tool (R package) that allows us to convert our R Markdown files into another,
more user friendly format like html or pdf.

The `knitr` package allow us to:

* Publish & share preliminary results with collaborators.
* Create professional reports that document our workflow and results directly
from our code, reducing the risk of accidental copy and paste or transcription errors.
* Document our workflow to facilitate reproducibility.
* Efficiently change code outputs (figures, files) given changes in the data, methods, etc.

>The knitr package was designed to be a transparent engine for dynamic report
generation with R --

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **When To Knit**: Knitting is a useful exercise
throughout your scientific workflow. It allows you to see what your outputs
look like and also to test that your code runs without errors.
The time required to knit depends on the length and complexity of the script
and the size of your data.

</figure>

To knit in RStudio, click the **knit** pull down button. You want to use the
**knit HTML** option for this lesson.

When you click the **Knit HTML** button, a  window will open in your console
titled R Markdown. This
pane shows the knitting progress. The output (HTML in this case) file will
automatically be saved in the current working directory. If there is an error
in the code, an error message will appear with a line number in the R Console
to help you diagnose the problem.

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip:** You can run `knitr` from the command prompt
using: `render(“input.Rmd”, “all”)`.

When knitting is complete, the HTML file produced will automatically open.

Notice that information from the YAML header (title, author, date) is printed
at the top of the HTML document. Then the HTML shows the text, code, and
results of the code that you included in the RMD document.

<div class="notice--warning" markdown="1">

## Activity: Create A Report Using Knitr & R Markdown

* Create a new .Rmd file in r studio. Name the file: `yourLastName-firstInitial-week1.Rmd`
example: `wasser-l-week1.Rmd`

* Add an `author:` line to the `YAML` header at the top of your `.Rmd` document.
* Give your file an appropriate title. Suggestion: `Earth Analytics Spring 2017 - Knitr Assignment`
* At the top of the document, add some text that describes:

   * What an Rmd file is
   * How you can use knitr in `R` and what it does.

* Add the code BELOW to your rmd document into a CODE CHUNK.
* Below the code chunk, add some TEXT that describes what the plot that you created
shows.
* Finally, describe what you like and don't like about the plot. If you could
change it, what would you change?

BONUS: If you know `R`, clean up the plot by adding labels and a title. Or better
yet, use `ggplot2`!


</div>


```r

# load the ggplot2 library for plotting
library(ggplot2)

# download data from figshare
# note that we are downloaded the data into your
download.file(url = "https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/7010681",
              destfile = "data/boulder-precip.csv")

# import data
boulder.precip <- read.csv(file="data/boulder-precip.csv")

# view first few rows of the data
head(boulder.precip)

# when we download the data we create a dataframe
# view each column of the data frame using it's name (or header)
boulder.precip$DATE

# view the precip column
boulder.precip$PRECIP

# q plot stands for quick plot. Let's use it to plot our data
qplot(x=boulder.precip$DATE,
      y=boulder.precip$PRECIP)

```

When you `knit` your `.Rmd` file to pdf, the plot you produce should look like
the one below. Not so pretty, eh? Don't worry - we will learn more about plotting
in a later tutorial!

## Where is the file?

In the steps above, we downloaded a file. However, where did that file go on your
computer? let's find it before we go any further.

```r

# what is the working directory?
getwd()

[1] "/Users/lewa8222/Documents/earth-analytics"

# set working dir as a variable
my.dir <- getwd()

# what files are in that working directory?
list.files(my.dir, recursive= TRUE)
```
Is the `boulder-precip.csv` file there?
