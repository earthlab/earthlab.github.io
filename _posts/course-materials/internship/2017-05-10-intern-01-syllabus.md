  * Meet with your faculty adviser at least twice during the semester. Faculty
  members are extremely busy, so work with them and your postdoctoral adviser to
  schedule meetings in advance. Meeting with them just prior to your midterm and
  final presentations will give you an opportunity to practice presenting before
  you present in front of others.
  * Participate in all research group meetings. Most lab groups have weekly
  meetings to discuss their current research and issues. This is a wonderful
  opportunity for you to participate in the research process.
