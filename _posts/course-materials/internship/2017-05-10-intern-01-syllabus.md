title: "The syntax of the R scientific programming language - Data Science for scientists 101"
excerpt: "This lesson introduces the basic syntax associated with the R scientific programming language. We will introduce assignment operators (<-), comments and basic functions that are available to use in R to perform basic tasks including head(), qplot() to quickly plot data and others. This lesson is designed for someone who has not used R before. We will work with precipitation and
stream discharge data for Boulder County."

## <i class="fa fa-graduation-cap" aria-hidden="true"></i> Learning Objectives
At the end of your internship with Earth Lab you will have gained the following skills:

* Skill one
* Skill two
* Maybe no more than 5 high level skills?

We may not need this and may opt to setup other sections

* [How to Setup R / RStudio](/course-materials/earth-analytics/week-1/setup-r-rstudio/)
* [Setup your working directory](/course-materials/earth-analytics/week-1/setup-working-directory/)
* [Intro to the R & RStudio Interface](/course-materials/earth-analytics/week-1/intro-to-r-and-rstudio)

</div>

In the [previous module](/course-materials/earth-analytics/week-1/setup-r-rstudio), we
setup `RStudio` and `R` and got to know the `RStudio` interface.
We also created a basic
`RMarkdown` report using `RStudio`. In this module, we will explore the basic
syntax of the `R` programming language. We will learn how to work with packages and
functions, how to work with vector objects in R and finally how to import data
into a data.frame which is the `R` equivalent of a spreadsheet.
