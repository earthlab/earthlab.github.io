Welcome to Earth Lab's internship program! The mission of our
internship is to immerse undergraduate students, like yourself, in current
earth-systems research here at CU-boulder. We hope that this program gives you the
confidence to present your research to different audiences in written and verbal
forms. Through seminars, online training modules and working closely with
postdoctoral researchers, faculty advisors, and the education team, you will learn
how to effectively communicate your research through writing and public speaking.

The end products of the internship include a midterm presentation and write-up
as well as a final presentation and paper.  As an intern, you be evaluated and
given feedback on your writing and presentation skills as wells as the progress
you make on goals you set at the beginning of the semester.

## <i class="fa fa-graduation-cap" aria-hidden="true"></i> Learning Objectives
At the end of your internship with Earth Lab you will have gained the following
skills:

  * A better understanding of your research group's subject area
  * Improved scientific writing skills
  * Improved public speaking skills
  * Accomplished the goals you set out for yourself at the start of the summer

## Assignments
Criteria for each assignment you complete is summer are below. Detailed
information on how each assignment is evaluated will be provided in the seminars
and as the assignment due dates get closer.

### Internship Goals Worksheet - **Due May 26th**
During your first week, you need to sit down with your postdoctoral adviser to
set analytical and content expertise goals to help guide your research for the
summer.

### Midterm Project - **Due June 30th**
  The midterm project will include an abstract and a presentation. Presentations
will be on Friday June 30th and electronic copies of the abstract and presentation
are due by the end of that day.

#### *Abstract:* 250-300 word abstract that will include:

  * *Background:* Briefly discuss the background of your research in the context
  of existing work and literature.

  * *Methods / Study area:* Briefly describe the methods you have been using
  and/or expect to use for your research this semester and the project study area.

  * *Expected Results :* Summarize the results you expect to get from your
  research this semester.

#### *Abstract Presentation:* Prepare a 10-minute presentation based you your
abstract.

  * Please minimize the amount of text on your slides. The more text on a slide,
  the less your audience is listening to you!

  * Be sure to carefully consider your audience and what they may or may not
  know. You will give your presentation to the education team, your postdoctoral
  adviser and each other. This audience will have a variety of background, so
  avoid using discipline-specific "jargon" terms.

### *Final Project* - **Due August 26th**
  The final project will consist of a scientific visualization and a presentation.
Please, use your imagination and come up with a creative way to visualize your
summer research.

## Intern Expectations
A key goal of the internship program is to fully immerse you in ongoing Earth Lab
research. To achieve this goal, we have the following expectations:

  * Spend all but two hours of your work hours in the Earth Lab office space.
  Earth Lab is *full* of knowledgeable people. Spending time in the office gives
  you the opportunity to collaborate with each other and other Earth Lab team
  members.

  * Meet you your postdoctoral adviser face-to-face at least once a week.
  This will ensure that your research stays on track and gives you time to ask
  them any questions you might have.

  * Meet with your faculty adviser at least twice during the semester. Faculty
  members are extremely busy, so work with them and your postdoctoral adviser to
  schedule meetings in advance. Meeting with them just prior to your midterm and
  final presentations will give you an opportunity to practice presenting before
  you present in front of others.

  * Participate in all research group meetings. Most lab groups have weekly
  meetings to discuss their current research and issues. This is a wonderful
  opportunity for you to participate in the research process.
