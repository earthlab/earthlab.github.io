The National Snow and Ice Data Center hosts soil moisture data (from the NASA Soil Moisture Active Passive project, described [here](https://nsidc.org/data/smap), and hereafter referred to as SMAP) which is provided in Several different formats. 

### Note: this tutorial has been deprecated

For accessing SMAP data with python, we recommend the [smap_io](https://github.com/TUW-GEO/smap_io/tree/master/tests) library.
