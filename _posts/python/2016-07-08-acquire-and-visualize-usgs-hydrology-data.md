Climata is a python package aimed at acquiring climate and water flow data from a variety of organizations including NOAA, CoCoRaHS, USBR, NWS, NRCS, and USGS. 
Here, we'll use climata to acquire streamflow data in and around Boulder, Colorado.

## Objectives

- Extracting stream flow data for a specific USGS station ID
- Extracting stream flow data for a county by FIPS code

## Dependencies


- [OWSLib](http://geopython.github.io/OWSLib/#installation)
- python 2.7 or 3.4
- [climata](https://github.com/heigeo/climata)

This is climata running in Python 3.4. 
Many data queries are possible through climata, some of which are demonstrated [here](http://climata.houstoneng.net/datarequests/).


```python
import matplotlib
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from climata.usgs import DailyValueIO
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

plt.style.use('ggplot')
%matplotlib inline
matplotlib.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = (14.0, 8.0)
```

## Extracting data for a specific USGS station ID

To acquire station data, you must know which station you want to access. 
There is a nice interactive application [here](http://maps.waterdata.usgs.gov/mapper/){:data-proofer-ignore=''} to do this. 


```python
# set parameters
nyears = 10
ndays = 365 * nyears
station_id = "06730200"
param_id = "00060"

datelist = pd.date_range(end=pd.datetime.today(), periods=ndays).tolist()
data = DailyValueIO(
    start_date=datelist[0],
    end_date=datelist[-1],
    station=station_id,
    parameter=param_id,
)
```


```python
# create lists of date-flow values
for series in data:
    flow = [r[0] for r in series.data]
    dates = [r[1] for r in series.data]
```


```python
plt.plot(dates, flow)
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel(series.variable_name)
plt.title(series.site_name)
plt.xticks(rotation='vertical')
plt.margins(0.2)
plt.show()
```

Note that the flooding in 2013 is fairly apparent.

## Extracting data for a county using a FIPS code

If we want data for all stations within a county, we need to query using the county FIPS code. 
The FIPS code for Boulder, CO is 08013:


```python
# set parameters
nyears = 1
ndays = 365 * nyears
county = "08013"
datelist = pd.date_range(end=pd.datetime.today(), periods=ndays).tolist()

data = DailyValueIO(
    start_date=datelist[0],
    end_date=datelist[-1],
    county=county,
)

date = []
value = []

for series in data:
    for row in series.data:
        date.append(row[1])
        value.append(row[0])
```


```python
site_names = [[series.site_name] * len(series.data) for series in data]

# unroll the list of lists
flat_site_names = [item for sublist in site_names for item in sublist]
```


```python
# bundle the data into a data frame
df = pd.DataFrame({'site': flat_site_names, 
                   'date': date, 
                   'value': value})

# remove missing values
df = df[df['value'] != -999999.0]
```


```python
# visualize flow time series, coloring by site
groups = df.groupby('site')
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
for name, group in groups:
    ax.plot(group.date, np.log(group.value), marker='o', linestyle='-', ms=2, label=name)
ax.legend(bbox_to_anchor=(1.05, 1), loc=2, borderaxespad=0.)
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('log(' + series.variable_name + ')')
plt.xticks(rotation='vertical')
plt.margins(0.2)
plt.show()
```

Note that there are gaps in the data, where points do not occur. 
Lines bridge areas lacking data.
