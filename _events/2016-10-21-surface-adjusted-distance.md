title: Surface adjusted distance metrics
text: Nearly all of spatial statistics relies on measurements of distance, which is often computed as the planar distance from one location to another. Friday, Yi Qiang will present come ongoing work to integrate LiDAR and digital elevation models to compute surface adjusted distances, which may more accurately reflect distances of interest for many physical and biological processes.
