title: Fire data jam session
text: Friday at 1 PM in SEEC S372 we'll jam out on some fire data, available on the PetaLibrary at /work/earthlab/NASA_fire_shared/data/fire/. So far we've discussed a lot of potential questions to be asked, including those around the spatial and temporal trends in fire occurrence/severity, differences in detectability/observation error through time, drivers of changes in dynamics, etc. We were going to dive in individually (or with partners) to investigate some of these questions. When we meet, we'll see what people put together!
