title: Introduction to Docker for scientific research
text: "Docker is a platform that bundles software dependencies with code. It's useful for ensuring that your application (e.g., your scientific analysis) can be run on heterogeneous architectures (e.g., your collaborators'). In this meetup, I'll give a high level overview of what Docker is, why it's useful, and we'll get everyone up and running with some simple applications.

Note: We are pushing the time slot for this meetup to 30 minutes earlier to give us all time to migrate from SEEC to main campus to see @lwasser give her Geography colloquium."
