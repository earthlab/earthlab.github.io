title: Extreme value theory III - rise of the threshold model
text: This week we'll learn about threshold models for extremes. Let's read chapter 4 in Coles' 2004 extreme value theory book, and try to apply the generalized Pareto distribution to either a) examples described in text (all datasets are contained in the R package "ismev", or b) fire data located on the Petalibrary (e.g., /work/earthlab/NASA_fire_shared/data/fire/Short+mtbs/). Implementations in any language are welcome! Once you have something worked out, please share it on GitHub so we can see what you did!
