## <i class="fa fa-home" aria-hidden="true"></i> Earth Analytics Spring 2017

This advanced, multidisciplinary course covers addressing major
questions in Earth science using computationally intensive approaches. Students
learn analytical tools necessary to undertake exploration of large, spatio-temporal
scientific data. The course is geared towards graduate and upper level (junior/
senior) undergraduate students in the natural/social sciences.

All students enrolled in the spring 2017 semester of Earth Analytics can request
access to <a href="http://www.datacamp.com" target="_blank">Data Camp</a>! Email the instructor for details!

### Example Course Science Topics (Topics subject to change):

* **Flooding & Erosion:** We will use data from in situ sensor networks including
USGS stream gage data and NOAA weather data to better understand flood event drivers
and impacts.
* **Fire:** We will use light detection and ranging (lidar) and spectral remote sensing data combined with on
the ground field measurements to better understand the drivers and impacts of
wildfires.
* **Permafrost:**
* **Climate & Society:** Social media and web as a powerful
means to understand climate impacts.

Throughout the semester, we will work together to build the
following skills:

* **Scientific programming:** Use the R / R-studio environment to
access, process & visualize scientific data.
* **Data Integration:** understand issues associated with
integration data from various sources (scale, resolution, format)
* **Find / access scientific data:** Programmatic (API) access of
data (NASA, USGS, etc.) via API’s.
* **Communication/Collaboration:** refine cross- discipline
collaborative writing and project development skills.
* **High Performance Computing (HPC):** implement large scale
data processing tasks on powerful remote servers.
* **Efficient data approaches:** process data more quickly via
using multiple “cores”.

### Semester Project

All students will select a topic for and use skills learned in the course to work
collaboratively on an end of the semester project.
