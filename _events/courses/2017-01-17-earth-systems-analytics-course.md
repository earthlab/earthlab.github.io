## About

This advanced, multidisciplinary course will address major questions in Earth
science and teach students to use the analytical tools necessary to undertake
exploration of ‘big scientific data’. If you are a graduate and undergraduate
(junior/senior) student in the natural/social science disciplines with an
interest in learning about computationally intensive science, this
course is for you.

### Example Course Science Topics (Topics subject to change):

* **Climate & Disturbance (Fire / Drought / Permafrost):** How
changing climate impacts natural disturbance systems.
* **Land Processes (Erosion):** Identify how rapid and slow
landscape evolution impacts our lives;
* **Vegetation:** Determine what is driving Colorado forest
dieback;
* **Climate & Society:** Social media and web as a powerful
means to understand climate impacts.
* **Data Integration:** understand issues associated with
integration data from various sources (scale, resolution, format)


Throughout the semester, we will work together to build the
following skills:

* **Scientific programming:** Use the R / R-studio environment to
access, process & visualize scientific data.
* **Find / access scientific data:** Programmatic (API) access of
data (NASA, USGS, etc.) via API’s.
* **Communication/Collaboration:** refine cross- discipline
collaborative writing and project development skills.
* **High Performance Computing (HPC):** implement large scale
data processing tasks on powerful remote servers.
* **Efficient data approaches:** process data more quickly via
using multiple “cores”.

### Semester Project

End of the semester Course Project: Students will choose a
science question of interest to explore throughout the semester.
They will apply skills learned in the course, to produce and
present a final project.
