Look at

http://neondataskills.org/R/Set-Working-Directory

a few screenshots may be useful

have them

1. go to the home space of their Computer
2. create earth-analytics folder (all rmd files will be stored there)
3. create /data dir (talk about good practice setting up a project)
4. Every time we start a script / .Rmd etc, save the rmd in the earth-analytics folder
and set that as the working dir.
