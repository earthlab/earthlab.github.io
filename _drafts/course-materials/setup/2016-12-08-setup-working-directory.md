## Setup your project

Project organization is integral to efficient research. A well organized project
structure will allow you to more easily find components of your project AND
make it easier for others you are working with to understand and find data, code,
and results.

## Setup Working Directory

Now that we have the basics of good project structure out of the way, let's get
our project setup. Go to the file space in R studio

have them:

1. go to the documents directory on their Computer
2. create earth-analytics folder (all rmd files will be stored there)
3. create /data dir (talk about good practice setting up a project)
4. Every time we start a script / .Rmd etc, save the rmd in the earth-analytics folder
and set that as the working dir.
