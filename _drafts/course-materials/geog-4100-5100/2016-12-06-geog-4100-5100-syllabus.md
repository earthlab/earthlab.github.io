## Attendance:

Attending all classes is required. In the event that you must miss a class due
to a university-approved activity, illness, injury, family emergency, or religious
observance, you must notify me, preferably before the day of class, and the absence
will be excused. Students will be given a reasonable amount of time to make up the
work based on the type of assignment missed and the reason for their absence.
Unexcused absences will indirectly affect the studentâ€™s grade because regular
participation is a requirement of this course.
