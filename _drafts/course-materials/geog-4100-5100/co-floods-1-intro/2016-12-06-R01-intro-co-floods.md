In this classroom activity we will actively engage with different types of data
that scientifically quantify / document the drivers (causes of) and impacts of
the flood using different methods.

<div class='notice--success' markdown="1">

# Learning Objectives
At the end of this activity, you will be able to:

* Use the timeline function in Google Earth to view time series imagery data
* Illustrate using a schematic graphic, the causes and impacts of a flood.
* Be able to define a driver and an impact of a disturbance.

## Exploring Flood Damage

In early September 2013, a slow moving cold air front moved through Colorado
intersecting with a warm, humid air front. The clash between the cold and warm
fronts yielded heavy rain. This rain, combined with a previous record of drought,
conditions associated with the soils in Colorado and other factors yielded and
devastating flooding across the Front Range in Colorado, USA.

Georeferenced imagery, collected using satellites and airplanes provides a powerful
visual record of landscape changes. Google Earth, has a time series feature that
allows you to look at imagery of the earth, across time. Let's have a look at some
of the visible changes.


## STEPS HERE ABOUT HOW TO DOWNLOAD AND VIEW TIME SERIES IN GOOGLE EARTH

* Open Google Earth
* Double click on the `.KMZ` file that you downloaded above. It should open in Google Earth.

> NOTE: the KMZ file might not be automatically associated with Google Earth. If
double clicking doesn't work, go to File --> Open in Google Earth. Navigate to the
location of your downloaded file (~Documents/data/co-flood/locations) and open it.

* Once you have the kml open, notice it is listed in the Temporary Places section
of the  `places` window. It should automatically zoom you into to an area in North
Boulder, Colorado. If it doesn't double click on the text `Locations of Significant Damage`.
* Click on the show historical imagery button in google earth

 <figcaption> The `show historical imagery` button allows you to turn on and slide
 through imagery from various points in time within Google Earth. It is the button
 outlined in pink in the above imaged.

</figure>

* When you click on the show historical imagery, a slider will appear in the upper
LEFT hand corner of your window. Scroll back and forth through time to get used
to the slider
* Finally, double click on one of the thumbtacks from locations of significant
damage file. Scroll to 10/2012 and then to 10/2013. Do you see any differences?
* Check out the other thumbtack. What differences do you see?

## Activity: What Changes do you see?

As a group, discuss the following questions. Record your answers following the
directions of your instructor (Google Doc, word document, etherpad, etc.).

* What differences to you see between 2012 and 2013?
  * For each difference: What you think caused that difference?
  * For each difference: How can you quantitatively record the differences?
* For each CAUSE listed above, could you somehow quantitatively record the "size" or impact of the cause?
* Was the cause - caused by something else? IE did something else DRIVE the cause?
* Create a diagram that illustrates the causes and effects (or drivers and impacts) of the flood. Is it a linear diagram? Is it quantifiable?

## Precipitation

Examine the plots below. Think about what the data may or may not be telling you.
Then answer the questions below.

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Precipitation:** is the moisture that
falls from clouds including rain, hail and snow.

## Activity: What do the data tell you about rainfall?

As a group, discuss the following questions. Record your answers following the
directions of your instructor (Google Doc, word document, etherpad, etc.).

* What differences to you see between 2012 and 2013?
  * For each difference: What you think caused that difference?

## Stream Flow (Discharge)

<i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Stream Discharge**, quantifies the volume of water
moving down a stream. Discharge is an ideal metric to quantify stream flow, which
increases significantly during a flood event.
