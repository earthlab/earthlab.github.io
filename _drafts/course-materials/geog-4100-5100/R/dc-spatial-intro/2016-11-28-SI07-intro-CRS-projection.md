## What is a Coordinate Reference System

To define the location of something we often use a coordinate system. This system
consists of an X and a Y value, located within a 2 (or more) -dimensional space.

	<img src="http://open.senecac.on.ca/clea/label/projectImages/15_276_xy-grid.jpg"></a>
	<figcaption> We use coordinate systems with X, Y (and sometimes Z axes) to
	define the location of objects in space.

	</figcaption>
</figure>

While the above coordinate system is 2-dimensional, we live on a 3-dimensional
earth that happens to be "round". To define the location of objects on the earth, which is round, we need
a coordinate system that adapts to the Earth's shape. When we make maps on paper
or on a flat computer screen, we move from a 3-Dimensional space (the globe) to
a 2-Dimensional space (our computer
screens or a piece of paper). The components of the CRS define how the
"flattening" of data that exists in a 3-D globe space. The CRS also defines the
the coordinate system itself.

entities. -- Wikipedia

## The Components of a CRS

The coordinate reference system is made up of several key components:

* **Coordinate System:** the X, Y grid upon which our data is overlayed and how we define where a point is located in space.
* **Horizontal and vertical units:** The units used to define the grid along the
x, y (and z) axis.
* **Datum:** A modeled version of the shape of the earth which defines the
origin used to place the coordinate system in space. We will explain this further,
below.
* **Projection Information:** the mathematical equation used to flatten objects
that are on a round surface (e.g. the earth) so we can view them on a flat surface
(e.g. our computer screens or a paper map).


## Why CRS is Important

It is important to understand the coordinate system that your data uses -
particularly if you are working with different data stored in different coordinate
systems. If you have data from the same location that are stored in different
coordinate reference systems, **they will not line up in any GIS or other program**
unless you have a program like ArcGIS or QGIS that supports **projection on the
fly**. Even if you work in a tool that supports projection on the fly, you will
want to all of your data in the same projection for performing analysis and processing
tasks.

excellent <a href="http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/" target="_blank">online
library of CRS information.</a>

### Coordinate System & Units

We can define a spatial location, such as a plot location, using an x- and a
y-value - similar to our cartesian coordinate system displayed in the figure,
above.

For example, the map below, generated in `R` with `ggplot2` shows all of the
continents in the world, in a `Geographic` Coordinate Reference System. The
units are Degrees and the coordinate system itself is **latitude** and
**longitude** with the `origin` being the location where the equator meets
the central meridian on the globe (0,0).



```r
library(rgdal)
library(ggplot2)
library(rgeos)
library(raster)

# be sure to set your working directory
# setwd("~/Documents/data")

# read shapefile
worldBound <- readOGR(dsn="Global/Boundaries/ne_110m_land",
                      layer="ne_110m_land")
```

```
## OGR data source with driver: ESRI Shapefile 
## Source: "Global/Boundaries/ne_110m_land", layer: "ne_110m_land"
## with 127 features
## It has 2 fields
```

```r
# convert to dataframe
worldBound_df <- fortify(worldBound)
```

```
## Regions defined for each Polygons
```

```r
# plot map
worldMap <- ggplot(worldBound_df, aes(long,lat, group=group)) +
  geom_polygon() +
  xlab("Longitude (Degrees)") + ylab("Latitude (Degrees)") +
  coord_equal() +
  ggtitle("Global Map - Geographic Coordinate System - WGS84 Datum\n Units: Degrees - Latitude / Longitude")

worldMap
```

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/rfigs/dc-spatial-intro/07-intro-CRS-projection/lat-long-example-1.png)

We can add three coordinate locations to our map. Note that the UNITS are
in decimal **degrees** (latitude, longitude):

* Boulder, Colorado:  40.0274, -105.2519
* Oslo, Norway: 59.9500, 10.7500
* Mallorca, Spain: 39.6167, 2.9833

Let's create a second map with the locations overlayed on top of the continental
boundary layer.


```r
# define locations of Boulder, CO and Oslo, Norway
# store them in a data.frame format
loc.df <- data.frame(lon=c(-105.2519, 10.7500, 2.9833),
                lat=c(40.0274, 59.9500, 39.6167))

# only needed if the above is a spatial points object
# loc.df <- fortify(loc)

# add a point to the map
mapLocations <- worldMap + geom_point(data=loc.df,
                        aes(x=lon, y=lat, group=NULL),
                      colour = "springgreen",
                      size=5)

mapLocations + theme(legend.position="none")
```

## Geographic CRS - The Good & The Less Good

Geographic coordinate systems in decimal degrees are helpful when we need to
locate places on the Earth. However, latitude and longitude
locations are not located using uniform measurement units. Thus, geographic
CRSs are not ideal for measuring distance. This is why other projected `CRS`
have been developed.

	location using angles. Thus the spacing of each line of latitude moving north
	and south is not uniform.

## Projected CRS - Robinson

We can view the same data above, in another CRS - `Robinson`. `Robinson` is a
**projected** `CRS`. Notice that the country boundaries on the map - have a
different shape compared to the map that we created above in the `CRS`:
**Geographic lat/long WGS84**.


```r
# reproject from longlat to robinson
worldBound_robin <- spTransform(worldBound,
                                CRS("+proj=robin"))

worldBound_df_robin <- fortify(worldBound_robin)
```

```
## Regions defined for each Polygons
```

```r
# force R to plot x and y values without abbrev
options(scipen=100)

robMap <- ggplot(worldBound_df_robin, aes(long,lat, group=group)) +
  geom_polygon() +
  labs(title="World map (robinson)") +
  xlab("X Coordinates (meters)") + ylab("Y Coordinates (meters)") +
  coord_equal()

robMap
```

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/rfigs/dc-spatial-intro/07-intro-CRS-projection/global-map-robinson-1.png)

Now what happens if you try to add the same Lat / Long coordinate locations that
we used above, to our map, with the `CRS` of `Robinsons`?


```r
# add a point to the map
newMap <- robMap + geom_point(data=loc.df,
                      aes(x=lon, y=lat, group=NULL),
                      colour = "springgreen",
                      size=5)

newMap + theme(legend.position="none")
```

![ ]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/rfigs/dc-spatial-intro/07-intro-CRS-projection/add-locations-robinson-1.png)

Notice above that when we try to add lat/long coordinates in degrees, to a map
in a different `CRS`, that the points are not in the correct location. We need
to first convert the points to the  new projection - a process often referred
to as **reprojection** but performed by the `spTransform()` function in `R`.


```r
# define locations of Boulder, CO and Oslo, Norway
loc.df
```

```
##         lon     lat
## 1 -105.2519 40.0274
## 2   10.7500 59.9500
## 3    2.9833 39.6167
```

```r
# convert to spatial Points data frame
loc.spdf <- SpatialPointsDataFrame(coords = loc.df, data=loc.df,
                            proj4string=crs(worldBound))

loc.spdf
```

```
## class       : SpatialPointsDataFrame 
## features    : 3 
## extent      : -105.2519, 10.75, 39.6167, 59.95  (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)
## coord. ref. : +proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs +ellps=WGS84 +towgs84=0,0,0 
## variables   : 2
## names       :       lon,     lat 
## min values  : -105.2519, 39.6167 
## max values  :     10.75,   59.95
```

```r
# reproject data to Robinson
loc.spdf.rob <- spTransform(loc.spdf, CRSobj = CRS("+proj=robin"))

loc.rob.df <- as.data.frame(cbind(loc.spdf.rob$lon, loc.spdf.rob$lat))
# rename each column
names(loc.rob.df ) <- c("X","Y")

# convert spatial object to a data.frame for ggplot
loc.rob <- fortify(loc.rob.df)

# notice the coordinate system in the Robinson projection (CRS) is DIFFERENT
# from the coordinate values for the same locations in a geographic CRS.
loc.rob
```

```
##            X       Y
## 1 -9162993.5 4279263
## 2   811462.5 6331141
## 3   260256.6 4235608
```

```r
# add a point to the map
newMap <- robMap + geom_point(data=loc.rob,
                      aes(x=X, y=Y, group=NULL),
                      colour = "springgreen",
                      size=5)

newMap + theme(legend.position="none")
```

## Compare Maps

Both of the plots above look visually different and also use a different
coordinate system. Let's look at both, side by side, with the actual **graticules**
or latitude and longitude lines rendered on the map.

NOTE: The code for this map can
be found in the .R document that is available for download at the bottom of this
page!

## Why Multiple CRS?

You may be wondering, why bother with different CRSs if it makes our
analysis more complicated? Well, each `CRS` is optimized to best represent:

* Shape and/or
* Scale / distance and/or
* Area

of features in the data. And no one CRS is great at optimizing shape, distance AND
area. Some CRSs are optimized for shape, some distance, some area. Some
CRSs are also optimized for particular regions -
for instance the United States, or Europe. Discussing `CRS` as it optimizes shape,
distance and area is beyond the scope of this tutorial, but it's important to
understand that the `CRS` that you chose for your data, will impact working with
the data!

<div id="challenge" markdown="1">
## Challenge

1. Compare the maps of the globe above. What do you notice about the shape of the
various countries. Are there any signs of distortion in certain areas on either
map? Which one is better?

2. Look at the image below - which depicts maps of the United States in 4 different
`CRS`s. What visual differences do you notice in each map? Look up each projection
online, what elements (shape,area or distance) does each projection used in
the graphic below optimize?

## Geographic vs Projected CRS


The above maps provide examples of the two main types of coordinate systems:

1. **Geographic coordinate systems:** coordinate systems that span the entire
globe (e.g. latitude / longitude).
2. **Projected coordinate Systems:** coordinate systems that are localized to
minimize visual distortion in a particular region (e.g. Robinson, UTM, State Plane)

In the next tutorial, we will discuss the differences between these CRSs in
more detail. Feel
free to skip over this section and come back to it with fresh eyes if the
concept of a `CRS` is becoming too complex. It's easisest to take on in
bite sized pieces!
