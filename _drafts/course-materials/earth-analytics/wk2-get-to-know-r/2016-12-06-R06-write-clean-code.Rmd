## What You Need

You need R and RStudio to complete this tutorial. Also we recommend have you
have an `earth-analytics` directory setup on your computer with a `/data`
directory with it.

## Consistent, Clean Code

Be consistent when you write your code (where you put spaces, how you name
variable, etc.). In R, two popular style guides are
[Hadley Wickham's](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html) and
[Google's](https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Rguide.xml). Pick
one and use it!
