# Introduction

Data analysis skills and earth science expertise are a powerful combination in
today's world of big data and rapid technological advancement. In order to forge
a successful career in the 21st century, earth scientists must be able to merge
both technical skills and domain expertise. The Earth Analytics Education Initiative
is a cutting-edge University of Colorado program that is responding to this new
reality by offering undergraduate and graduate courses, a professional certificate,
online training materials, an internship program and ultimately, a professional
master's degree in Earth Data Analytics. In addition to being timely, the Earth
Analytics Education Initiative is also innovative - while there are a wealth of
programs that focus on earth systems and data science individually, it is one of
the first university programs in the U.S. to combine these disciplines.

To ensure that the skills taught in our program make individuals who already work
in the sciences or who are interested in finding work in the sciences more marketable
to employers, our team surveyed industry representatives who require staff with
earth analytics skills in the fall of 2016. The goal of this survey was to inform
and guide development of the professional graduate certificate and future full
professional master's program in Earth Data Analytics. In tandem with this effort,
Earth Lab sent the same survey to members of the academic community - anticipating
that some of the tools and identified needs may be different in the academic
community compared to the industry community.

The Professional graduate certificate - **Earth Data Analytics - Foundations** -
will launch in August 2018. The professional certificate in Earth Analytics provides
a professional student with the core skills required for a career in and further
career growth in computationally intensive earth sciences. These skills include
the ability to:
* Address domain specific scientific challenges and questions using readily
available, multi-dimensional, data streams.
* Efficiently process, integrate, analyze, and visualize heterogeneous
spatio-temporal data.
* Communicate effectively across disciplines.
* Efficiently and effectively collaborate with colleagues in team environments.


# Methods

The Earth Analytics team gathered the initial list of industry survey participants
following a data intensive meeting that was held at the University of Colorado,
Boulder. We added several participants to this list given employment in other key
industry organizations. The industry representatives included were
generally either hiring managers or executives, which ensured that they had an
accurate perspective of their organization’s needs. We identified members of the
academic community through participation in Earth Lab, ESIP (Earth Science
Information Partners) and solicitation via social media (Twitter).

Survey participants represented a mix of industry and academic backgrounds. Three
participants identified as being members of the public sector / agencies but all
had academic affiliations and were thus included in the academic type. Earth Lab
plans to perform a follow up survey to target individuals in the public sector
including Non governmental organizations (NGO's), government agencies and other
organizations.

### Organization size

Organizations surveyed were on average, large (250+ employees)
and operated both inside of the United States and across the globe.

### Participant science domains

Survey participants represented a range of scientific and applied domain areas that
work within the realm of Earth Science and have a strong computational component.

### Tuition reimbursement

We asked participants whether their organization supported professional development
in the form of tuition reimbursement or time allocated to taking classes. This
question specifically allowed us to better understand the willingness of employers
to support employee professional development through programs such as the CU Earth
Data Analytics - Foundations professional certificate. Further it helped us better
understand potential professional student time availability which guides decisions
about course schedule and asynchronous vs synchronous course approaches. Synchronous
learning refers to course learning that happens in the classroom under the guidance
of an instructor at specific times. Conversely, asynchronous learning refers to
flexibility in absorbing course content at any time during a given time period.
A popular example of asynchronous learning are MOOC courses offered through platforms
such as Coursera and EdX.

The majority of the organizations surveyed do support professional development and
would thus support sending employees to a professional program, if the coursework
provided key skills that employees require to perform daily tasks. Most academic
employers surveyed provide both tuition assistance and time allocated for employees
to pursue coursework, whereas most industry employers provide tuition assistance
only.

Given that few industry employers offered time or flexibility for employees to
undertake coursework during work hours, it is important that the certificate courses
are offered asynchronously, in a flexible format that allows for completion during
evenings and weekends. This supports our program design which provides asynchronous
and synchronous online course offerings.

# Scientific programming / data analysis tools

Survey participants consistently ranked scientific programming, which facilitates
efficient processing, visualization and analysis of data as important. Survey
respondents identified a variety of programming languages that were important to
career development, however, several tools stood out as being more commonly used.
Industry survey participants ranked Python as the most important programming language,
closely followed by Javascript, C++, and Java. Academic participants most consistently
ranked R highly, closely followed by Python. We included Microsoft Excel in the
survey as a gauge to better understand who is using this tool vs. other non-GUI
(graphical user interface) based tools.

Personal conversations with several industry representatives suggested that both
R and Python are commonly used in daily workflows. Specifically, some industry
employees use R for robust interactive tool development (e.g. Shiny Apps). The
prevalence of using Python in industry can likely be attributed to it being:

1. A more generic programming language and
2. Often the native language in GIS applications (ArcGIS, QGIS, etc.)


<img src="{{ site.url }}/images//blog/2017-06-11-blog-industry-science-survey/scientific-programming-1.png" title="The comparative importance of scientific programming tools to academic (public sector) vs  industry (private sector) organizations." alt="The comparative importance of scientific programming tools to academic (public sector) vs  industry (private sector) organizations." width="100%" />

## Reproducible / repeatable workflows

Reproducible or repeatable workflows refer to methods that can be reused to process
and analyze data with a strong emphasis on efficiency.Not surprisingly, both industry
and academic respondents emphasized the importance of efficient, reproducible computing
approaches throughout the survey.

Both industry and academic survey participants generally ranked the following skills
as important:

* Automating tasks & workflows
* Using version control systems (e.g. Git / GitHub)
* Writing scientific code that others can easily use / reuse

Industry participants further emphasized other skills including:

* Containerized workflows
* Cloud computing
* Efficient scalable computing (Hadoop, Spark, MapReduce, etc)

It is important to note that many industry organizations are moving away from
the conventional high performance computing (HPC) model, where the organization
maintains servers that its employees can use to support large data processing
tasks, instead moving towards cloud computing. This can be seen in the results below
where cloud computing environments were more often ranked as extremely important
compared to HPC applications.

Both industry and academic survey respondents ranked several skills that we
expected to be important, such as parallel programming approaches and containerized
workflows, lower than expected. This was surprising because these approaches
support efficient workflows, which respondents consistently rated as extremely /
very important. A potential explanation for this is that participants were less
familiar with these skills or the incorrect terminology was used to convey these
skills.


<img src="{{ site.url }}/images//blog/2017-06-11-blog-industry-science-survey/reprod-workflows-1.png" title="The degree of importance that potential employers assigned to various skills associated with creating automated and reproducible workflows. " alt="The degree of importance that potential employers assigned to various skills associated with creating automated and reproducible workflows. " width="100%" />

# Data integration & remote sensing

Next, we asked survey participants to evaluate the types of scientific technical
knowledge that are important for an employee to have in order to pursue a career
with their organization or in their field.

Industry respondents placed the greatest emphasis on understanding of remote
sensing data and statistical approaches to answering questions. It is important
to note that industry participant comments in response to our survey questions
emphasized the importance of application of these skills to practical (“real
world”) problems with realistic data, rather than pre-cleaned data that is often
used in courses. Thus we will consider and implement the use of real world
applications in the design of our professional programs.

As we expected, academic participants placed a higher emphasis on developing and
answering scientific questions, understanding statistical approaches and writing
articles for peer review. Academic respondents were also highly interested in
candidates who understand statistical approaches.


<img src="{{ site.url }}/images//blog/2017-06-11-blog-industry-science-survey/science-knowledge-1.png" title="The degree of importance that potential employers assigned to various scientific skills." alt="The degree of importance that potential employers assigned to various scientific skills." width="100%" />




## Data integration & metadata skills


Both industry and academic respondents found data integration skills to be important.
The skills that respondents most commonly ranked as extremely important included:

* Integration of data from multiple sources
* Knowledge of hierarchical data structures
* Knowledge of how to work with remote sensing data

Industry participants placed a slightly lower emphasis on understanding of metadata
structures and knowledge of best data management practices compared to academic
participants and a slightly higher emphasis on the use of database systems (e.g. SQL).

The theme of integrating heterogeneous data is a strong thread throughout the
Professional Graduate Certificate in Earth Data Analytics - Foundations.

# Communication / dissemination of scientific results

Both industry and academic survey respondents identified interdisciplinary communication
as extremely important. These respondents also found use of collaborative tools
and writing technical reports to be important. As expected, academic respondents
emphasized technical writing skills more strongly than industry respondents did.

Industry and academic respondents had the most divided opinions on issues surrounding
dissemination of results through blogging, social media and other platforms and
public engagement. It is likely that these skills may vary according to the specific
position being considered within the company.

## Data visualization

Among industry participants, the importance of various data visualization approaches
was specific to each participant depending upon their industry focus. However
industry respondents did place higher importance on dynamic interactive graphic
creation compared to academic respondents. This response is consistent with personal
discussions with industry representatives who communicated that they used interactive
applications (e.g. Shiny apps) to dynamically develop and test systems, hardware
and software. Academic respondents ranked the ability to create report quality
graphics as by far the most sought after skill. Most participants agreed that
knowledge of basic figure generation for reports was important.

# Database / cloud computing / containerization tools

## Database tools

Database tools encapsulate data management tools that are used to store, organize
and access data. The importance of individual database tools varied across both
the industry and academic domains and across participants. Overall industry participants
identified the use of database tools as more important than academic sector participants
did. Industry respondents generally used a variety of tools however, not surprisingly,
they more commonly listed SQL as very important compared to the open source Postgresql
option and ESRI's ArcSDE platform. Following survey results, the academic sector
seems to use database tools less however; academic participants most commonly
identified SQL as an important tool.

## High Performance Computing

High performance computing (HPC) is infrastructure that uses a combination of efficient
hardware and software to execute computational tasks faster and more reliably.
Industry participants identified Linux and GPU Programming as core HPC tools that
are important to career development. Academic participants most frequently identified
Linux as an important tool. It is important to note that many of the tools being
used in industry including Hadoop, Spark and MapReduce do not seem to be as frequently
used in the academic sector. In most instances, participants stated that they were
not familiar with these tools (this option is not represented in the plots).

<img src="{{ site.url }}/images//blog/2017-06-11-blog-industry-science-survey/hpc-1.png" title="The importance of understanding high performance computing tools according to potential employers surveyed." alt="The importance of understanding high performance computing tools according to potential employers surveyed." width="100%" />

## Cloud computing / containerization tools

Cloud computing is the use of a network of remote servers, rather than local servers
or personal computers, for storing and processing data. Containerization refers
to creating local virtual environments that contains all of the tools required to
run a workflow. A commonly used containerization tool is Docker. Industry respondents
consistently suggested that Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Docker were important
tools to be familiar with. Academic survey respondents did not place a high importance
on cloud computing or containerization tools, though some were interested in prospective
employees possessing skills with the cloud computing tool AWS and the containerization
tool Docker. In general, we are finding a trend of organizations moving away from
HPC environments and moving towards cloud environments such as AWS.

# Geographic Information Systems (GIS)

Geographic Information systems (GIS) involves the use of spatial data to better
understand patterns in the landscape. While many people use tools like Python and
R to work with GIS data, in this section of the survey we focused on the use of
explicit GIS tools including GUI based tools (ENVI, QGIS and ESRI), command line
tools (GDAL / OGR, GRASS) and web mapping tools to better understand what tools
specifically are most commonly used. Among industry participants, not surprisingly,
most employers view the ESRI ArcMap suite as important. Knowledge of web mapping
tools was also listed as important in industry. The academic communities responses
were more evenly spread across the various tools.

# Open ended feedback

At the end of the survey, we asked several open ended questions to provide
opportunity for discussion about key components of a professional program that
the focused questions above may have missed.

## What skills are in the most demand

> Please describe the skills / expertise that an ideal candidate for a job within your organization would have.

First we asked participants to describe the types of skills that they are looking
for in their employees. This question allowed for more candid, open responses
rather than selecting from skills that we had identified as important.

# Summary

The feedback gathered in this survey provides useful insight into the types of
skills and knowledge that are being sought in industry. Further it shed light on
some potential differences in approach and tools used in industry vs. the academic
community. It is important to note that our participant base was not completely
randomized in this survey and that numbers were small. Thus these results may not
be completely representative of industry at large. However we are confident that
these results represent the earth science community that interacts with CU Boulder
and Earth Lab.

A few summary conclusions based upon the survey are included below:

## Earth science + data science skills are sought

In general the combination of earth science domain knowledge with programmatic data
processing, analysis and visualization was consistently emphasized. While scientists
do not need to be programmers, programming skills are becoming more of a requirement
to succeed in the professional earth science industry. In recent years there has
been a deluge of new data science programs. However increasingly employers are
communicating the need for individuals with applied experience in their field
combined with data science skills.

A few statements that support this conclusion extracted from the survey include:

> Some programming skills are essential for most technical and scientific degree programs.

> Science and technology understanding with demonstrated programming skills

## Real world data applied experience is important

Many participants emphasized the importance of job applicant's applied experience
with real world data. Often, courses and workshops provide "cleaned" data to use
to optimize the teaching experience. However, it is known that the reality of
working with new data on a project is that many steps are required to clean and
"munge" the data into a usable format. Employers want to see these applied skills.

> One of the most important issues we face is candidates who have not worked with real data. Many are very advanced in their statistics and programming knowledge, but haven't had experience with data that haven't been pre-cleaned, organized, and described. Learning how to evaluate, understand/interpret, and organize data to answer your research questions is critical.

## ESRI tools are important to be familiar with but so are open source

In general the use of ESRI’s ArcMap is still prevalent in both industry and
academia. However, increasingly employers are emphasizing the importance of open
source tools - combined with knowledge of the ESRI suite.

> The professional geospatial world is changing at a rapid pace, while Esri still holds a strong grip on the market there is an emerging need to individuals with a broad set of skills related to open source software and development platforms, webGIS, and programming.

Employers further emphasized the importance of ESRI web mapping tools
as being even potentially more important than knowledge of the desktop tools.

> ArcGIS web mapping tools are most important vs. just esri desktop tools - probably more important than desktop

## R vs. Python - the ongoing debate

The use of tools varied across both industry and academic sectors. However generally
feedback suggests that knowledge of at least one programming language demonstrates
a potential candidate's ability to programmatically work with data. R and Python
remain the frontrunner languages in both industry and academia.

> I want to see fluency in one open scripting language (R or Python) and creative problem solving. The fluency in one language tells me that a candidate can learn another language. I want to see some systems thinking analysis and the ability to reduce large scale problems into smaller pieces (This is all part of why a PhD is so useful in academics). I also want someone who can speak broadly about the industry and its challenges, not just repeat textbook examples or show code they’ve developed in a class.

This feedback further reinforces the importance of teaching programming core skills
that will allow a student to move from one program to another rather than simply
teaching “a language”.

## Provide courses that support asynchronous learning

While it is common for companies to reimburse a portion of tuition costs for employee
professional development, it is rare for them to offer time during the workday for
employees to complete their coursework. As the certificate will be aimed at working
professionals, this finding underscores the importance of offering courses in a
flexible online format that can be done on evenings and weekends.
