## About Vector Data
Vector data are composed of discrete geometric locations (x,y values) known as
**vertices** that define the "shape" of the spatial object. The organization
of the vertices, determines the type of vector that we are working
with: point, line or polygon.

    <figcaption> There are 3 types of vector objects: points, lines or
    polygons. Each object type has a different structure.

</figure>

* **Points:** Each individual point is defined by a single x, y coordinate.
There can be many points in a vector point file. Examples of point data include:
sampling locations, the location of individual trees or the location of plots.
* **Lines:** Lines are composed of many (at least 2) vertices, or points, that
are connected. For instance, a road or a stream may be represented by a line. This
line is composed of a series of segments, each "bend" in the road or stream
represents a vertex that has defined `x, y` location.
* **Polygons:** A polygon consists of 3 or more vertices that are connected and
"closed". Thus the outlines of plot boundaries, lakes, oceans, and states or
countries are often represented by polygons. Occasionally, a polygon can have a
hole in the middle of it (like a doughnut), this is something to be aware of but
not an issue we will deal with in this tutorial.

 <i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip:** Sometimes, boundary layers such as
 states and countries, are stored as lines rather than polygons. However, these
 boundaries, when represented as a line, will not create a closed object with a defined "area" that can be "filled".
{: .notice}

## Shapefiles: Points, Lines, and Polygons
Geospatial data in vector format are often stored in a `shapefile` format.
Because the structure of points, lines, and polygons are different, each
individual shapefile can only contain one vector type (all points, all lines
or all polygons). You will not find a mixture of point, line and polygon
objects in a single shapefile.

Objects stored in a shapefile often have a set of associated `attributes` that
describe the data. For example, a line shapefile that contains the locations of
streams, might contain the associated stream name, stream "order" and other
information about each stream line object.

* More about shapefiles can found on
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>.

## Import Shapefiles

We will use the `rgdal` package to work with vector data in `R`. Notice that the
`sp` package automatically loads when `rgdal` is loaded. We will also load the
`raster` package so we can explore raster and vector spatial metadata using similar commands.

```{r load-libraries }
# work with spatial data; sp package will load with rgdal.
library(rgdal)
# for metadata/attributes- vectors or rasters
library(raster)

# set working directory to earth-analytics dir
# setwd("pathToDirHere")
```

The shapefiles that we will import are:

* A polygon shapefile representing our field site boundary,
* A line shapefile representing roads, and
* A point shapefile representing the location of the Fisher
<a href="http://www.neonscience.org/science-design/collection-methods/flux-tower-measurements" target="_blank">flux tower</a>
located at the
<a href="http://www.neonscience.org/science-design/field-sites/harvard-forest" target="_blank"> NEON Harvard Forest field site</a>.

The first shapefile that we will open contains the boundary of our study area
(or our Area Of Interest or AOI, hence the name `aoiBoundary`). To import
shapefiles we use the `R` function `readOGR()`.

`readOGR()` requires two components:

1. The directory where our shapefile lives: `data/week4/D17-California/SJER/vector_data/`
2. The name of the shapefile (without the extension): `SJER_plot_centroids`

Let's import our AOI.

```{r Import-Shapefile}

# Import a polygon shapefile: readOGR("path","fileName")
# no extension needed as readOGR only imports shapefiles

sjer_plot_locations <- readOGR("data/week4/california/SJER/vector_data/",
                      layer="SJER_plot_centroids")


```

## Shapefile Metadata & Attributes

When we import the `HarClip_UTMZ18` shapefile layer into `R` (as our
`sjer_crop_extent` object), the `readOGR()` function automatically stores
information about the data. We are particularly interested in the geospatial
**metadata**, describing the format, `CRS`, `extent`, and other components of
the vector data, and the **attributes** which describe properties associated
with each individual vector object.

 <i class="fa fa-star"></i> **Data Tip:** The
 [Shapefile Metadata & Attributes in R]({{site.baseurl}}/R/shapefile-attributes-in-R/)
tutorial provides more information on both metadata and attributes
and using attributes to subset and plot data.
{: .notice}

## Spatial Metadata
Key metadata for all shapefiles include:

1. **Object Type:** the class of the imported object.
2. **Coordinate Reference System (CRS):** the projection of the data.
3. **Extent:** the spatial extent (geographic area that the shapefile covers) of
the shapefile. Note that the spatial extent for a shapefile represents the
extent for ALL spatial objects in the shapefile.

We can view shapefile metadata using the `class`, `crs` and `extent` methods:

```{r view-metadata }
# view just the class for the shapefile
class(sjer_plot_locations)

# view just the crs for the shapefile
crs(sjer_plot_locations)

# view just the extent for the shapefile
extent(sjer_plot_locations)

# view all metadata at same time
sjer_plot_locations
```

Our `sjer_plot_locations` object is a polygon of class `SpatialPointsDataFrame`,
in the CRS **UTM zone 18N**. The CRS is critical to interpreting the object
`extent` values as it specifies units.

    <figcaption>The spatial extent of a shapefile or R spatial object represents
    the geographic "edge" or location that is the furthest north, south east and
    west. Thus is represents the overall geographic coverage of the spatial object.

</figure>

## Spatial Data Attributes
Each object in a shapefile has one or more attributes associated with it.
Shapefile attributes are similar to fields or columns in a spreadsheet. Each row
in the spreadsheet has a set of columns associated with it that describe the row
element. In the case of a shapefile, each row represents a spatial object - for
example, a road, represented as a line in a line shapefile, will have one "row"
of attributes associated with it. These attributes can include different types
of information that describe objects stored within a shapefile. Thus, our road,
may have a name, length, number of lanes, speed limit, type of road and other
attributes stored with it.

<figure>
    <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/course-materials/earth-analytics/week-4/Attribute_Table.png">
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/course-materials/earth-analytics/week-4/Attribute_Table.png"></a>
    <figcaption>Each spatial feature in an R spatial object has the same set of
    associated attributes that describe or characterize the feature.
    Attribute data are stored in a separate *.dbf file. Attribute data can be
    compared to a spreadsheet. Each row in a spreadsheet represents one feature
    in the spatial object.
    Image Source: National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON)
    </figcaption>
</figure>


We view the attributes of a `SpatialPointsDataFrame` using `objectName@data`
(e.g., `sjer_plot_locations@data`).

``` {r Shapefile-attributes-2}
# alternate way to view attributes
sjer_plot_locations@data

```

In this case, our polygon object only has one attribute: `id`.

## Metadata & Attribute Summary
We can view a metadata & attribute summary of each shapefile by entering
the name of the `R` object in the console. Note that the metadata output
includes the **class**, the number of **features**, the **extent**, and the
**coordinate reference system** (`crs`) of the `R` object. The last two lines of
`summary` show a preview of the `R` object **attributes**.

```{r shapefile-summary}
# view a summary of metadata & attributes associated with the spatial object
summary(sjer_plot_locations)

```


# Plot a Shapefile
Next, let's visualize the data in our `R` `spatialpolygonsdataframe` object using
`plot()`.

``` {r plot-shapefile, fig.cap="SJER plot locations."}
# create a plot of the shapefile
# 'lwd' sets the line width
# 'col' sets internal color
# 'border' sets line color
plot(sjer_plot_locations, col="blue",
     pch=8,
     main="Plot Locations")

```

## Optional challenge: Import Line and Polygon Shapefiles

Using the steps above, import the `data/week4/california/madera-county-roads/tl_2013_06039_roads` 
and `data/week4/california/SJER/vector_data/SJER_crop.shp` shapefiles into
`R`. Call the roads object `sjer_roads` and the crop layer 
`sjer_crop_extent`.

Answer the following questions:

1. What type of `R` spatial object is created when you import each layer?
2. What is the `CRS` and `extent` for each object?
3. Do the files contain, points, lines or polygons?
4. How many spatial objects are in each file?
</div>

```{r import-point-line, echo=FALSE, results="hide" }
# import line shapefile
sjer_roads <- readOGR("data/week4/california/madera-county-roads",
                      layer = "tl_2013_06039_roads")

sjer_crop_extent <- readOGR("data/week4/california/SJER/vector_data/",
                            "SJER_crop")

# 1
class(sjer_roads)
class(sjer_plot_locations)

# 2
crs(sjer_roads)
extent(sjer_roads)
crs(sjer_plot_locations)
extent(sjer_plot_locations)

# 3
#sjer_roads contains only lines and sjer_plot_locations contains only 1 point

# 4 -> numerous ways to find this; sjer_roads=13,
length(sjer_roads)  #easiest, but not previously taught
sjer_roads  #look at 'features'
attributes(sjer_roads)  #found in the $data section as above

# Alternative code for 1-4: view metadata/attributes all at once
sjer_roads
attributes(sjer_roads)

```

## Plot Multiple Shapefiles
The `plot()` function can be used for basic plotting of spatial objects.
We use the `add = TRUE` argument to overlay shapefiles on top of each other, as
we would when creating a map in a typical GIS application like QGIS.

We can use `main=""` to give our plot a title. If we want the title to span two
lines, we use `\n` where the line should break.

```{r plot-multiple-shapefiles }
# Plot multiple shapefiles
plot(sjer_crop_extent, col = "lightgreen",
     main="NEON Harvard Forest\nField Site")
plot(sjer_roads, add = TRUE)

# use the pch element to adjust the symbology of the points
plot(sjer_plot_locations, add  = TRUE, pch = 19, col = "purple")
```
