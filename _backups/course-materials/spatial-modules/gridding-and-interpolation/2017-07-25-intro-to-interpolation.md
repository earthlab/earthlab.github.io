## Triangulated Irregular Network (TIN)

The Triangulated Irregular Network (TIN) is a vector based surface where sample
points (nodes) are connected by a series of edges creating a triangulated surface.
The TIN format remains the most true to the point distribution, density and spacing of a
dataset. It also may yield the largest file size!

## About Rasters

A raster is a dataset made up of cells or pixels. Each pixel represents a value
associated with a region on the earthâ€™s surface. We can create a raster from points
through a process sometimes called gridding. Gridding is the process of taking a
set of points and using them to create a surface composed of a regular grid.

    <img src="{{ site.url }}/images/course-materials/spatial-modules/interpolation-101/gridded.png" alt = "When you directly grid a dataset, values will only be calculated for cells that overlap with data points. Thus, data gaps will not be filled."></a>
    <figcaption>When you directly grid a dataset, values will only be calculated
	for cells that overlap with data points. Thus, data gaps will not be filled.
	</figcaption>
</figure>

When creating a raster, you may chose to perform a direct **gridding** of the data.
This means that you calculate one value for every cell in the raster where there
are sample points. This value may be a mean of all points, a max, min or some other
mathematical function. All other cells will then have `no data` values associated with
them. This means you may have gaps in your data if the point spacing is not well
distributed with atleast one data point within the spatial coverage of each raster
cell.

## Spatial Interpolation

Spatial **interpolation** involves calculating the value for a  query point (or
a raster cell) with an unknown value from a set of known sample point values that
are distributed across an area. There is a general assumption that points closer
to the query point, are more strongly related to that cell than those further away.
 However this general assumption is applied differently across different
interpolation functions.

## Deterministic vs. Probabilistic Interpolators

There are two main types of interpolation approaches:

* **Deterministic**: create surfaces from measured points using a weighted distance
 or area function.
* **Probabilistic (Geostatistical)**: utilize the statistical properties of the
 measured points. Probabilistic techniques quantify the spatial auto-correlation
 among measured points and account for the spatial configuration of the sample
 points around the prediction location.

We will focus on deterministic methods in this workshop.

## Deterministic Interpolation Methods

Let's look at a few different deterministic interpolation methods to understand
how different methods can affect an output raster.

### Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW)

Inverse distance weighted interpolation (IDW) calculates the values of a query point
(a cell with an unknown value)  using a linearly weighted combination of values
from nearby points.

<figure>
    <a href="https://docs.qgis.org/2.2/en/_images/idw_interpolation.png">
	<img src="https://docs.qgis.org/2.2/en/_images/idw_interpolation.png" alt ="IDW interpolation calculates the value of an unknown cell center value (a query point) using surrounding points with the assumption that closest points will be the most similar to the value of interest."></a>
    <figcaption>
	IDW interpolation calculates the value of an unknown cell center value (a
	query point) using 	surrounding points with the assumption that closest points
	will be the most similar to the value of interest.
</figcaption>

</figure>


**Key Attributes of IDW Interpolation:**

* Raster is derived based upon an assumed linear relationship between the
location of interest and the distance to surrounding sample points.
* Sample points closest to the cell of interest are assumed to be more related
to its value than those further away.
* Exact - Can not interpolate beyond the min/max range of data point values.
* Can only estimate within the range of EXISTING sample point values - this can
yield "flattened" peaks and valleys" especially if the data didn't capture those
high and low points.
* Point average values
* Good for data that are equally distributed and  dense. Assumes a consistent
trend / relationship between points and does not accommodate trends within the data
(e.g. east to west, etc).

#### Power

There power setting in IDW interpolation specifies how strongly points further
away from the cell value of interest impact the calculated value for that call.
Power values range from 0-3+ with a default settings generally being 2. A larger
power value produces a more localized result - values further away from the cell
have less impact on it's calculated value, values closer to the cell impact it's
value more. A smaller power value produces a more averaged result where sample points
further away from the cell have a greater impact on the cell's calculated value.

The impacts of power

**Lower Power Values** more averaged result, potential for a smoother surface.
As Power decreases, the influence of sample points is larger. This yields a smoother
surface that is more averaged.

**Higher Power Values**: more localized result, potential for more peaks and
around sample point locations.
As Power increases, the influence of sample points falls off more rapidly with
distance. The output cell values become more localized and less averaged.


### IDW Summary Take Home Points

**GOOD FOR: **

* Data whose distribution is strongly (and linearly) correlated with
distance. For example, noise falls off very predictably with distance.
* Provides explicit control over the influence of distance; (compared to Spline
or Kriging).

**NOT AS GOOD FOR:**

* Not as good for data whose distribution depends on more complex sets of variables
 because it can account only for the effects of distance.

**OTHER FEATURES:**

* You can create a smoother surface by decreasing the power, increasing the
number of sample points used, or increasing the search radius.
* Create a surface that more closely represents the peaks and dips of your sample
points by decreasing the number of sample points used / decreasing the search
radius, increasing the power.
* Increase IDW surface accuracy by adding breaklines to the interpolation process
that serve as barriers. Breaklines represent abrupt changes in elevation, such
as cliffs.

### Spline

Spline interpolation fits a curved surface through the sample points of your
dataset. Imagine stretching a rubber sheet across your points and glueing it to
each sample point along the way. Unlike IDW, spline can estimate values above and
below the min and max values of your sample points. Thus it is good for estimating
high and low values not already represented in your data.

### Regularized vs Tension Spline

There are two types of curved surfaces that can be fit when using spline interpolation:

	<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/course-materials/spatial-modules/interpolation-101/reg_ten_Spline.png" alt ="Regular vs tension spline.">
	</a>

    <figcaption>
	Regular vs tension spline.
	</figcaption>
</figure>

1. **Tension spline:** a flatter surface that forces estimated values to stay closer
to the known sample points.

2. **Regularized spline:** a more elastic surface that is more likely to estimate above
and below the known sample points.


SPLINE IS GOOD FOR:

* Estimating values outside of the range of sample input data.
* Creating a smooth continuous surface.

NOT AS GOOD FOR:

* Points that are close together and have large value differences. Slope calculations
can yield over and underestimation.
* Data with large, sudden changes in values that need to be represented (eg fault
lines, extreme vertical topographic changes, etc). IDW allows for breaklines. NOTE:
some tools like ARCGIS have introduces a spline with barriers function in recent
years.

### Natural Neighbor Interpolation

Natural neighbor interpolation  finds the closest subset of data points, to the
query point of interest. It then applies weights to those points, to calculate an
average estimated value based upon their proportionate areas derived from their
corresponding voronoi polygons. The natural neighbor interpolator adapts locally
to the input data, using points surrounding the query point of interest. Thus there
are no radius, number of points or other settings needed when using this approach.

This interpolation method works equally well on regular vs irregularly spaced data.

FROM THE ESRI HELP:
> By comparison, a distance-based interpolator tool such as IDW (inverse distance weighted) would assign similar weights to the northernmost point and to the northeastern point based on their similar distance from the interpolation point. Natural neighbor interpolation, however, assigns weights of 19.12 percent and 0.38 percent, respectively, which is based on the percentage of overlap.

Notes about Natural Neighbor

* Local Interpolator
* Interpolated values fall within the range of values of the sample data
* Surface passes through input samples
* Supports breaklines


**Natural Neighbor is good for:**

* Data who's spatial distribution is variable (AND data that are equally distributed).
* Categorical data
* Providing a smoother output raster.

**Natural Neighbor is not as good for:**

* Data where the interpolation needs to be spatially constrained (to a particular
number of points of distance).
* Data where sample points further away from or beyond the immediate "neighbor points"
need to be considered in the estimation.
