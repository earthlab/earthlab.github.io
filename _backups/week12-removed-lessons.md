#### Plot 3

Using the population projection data that we used in this lesson ,
 create a plot of projected
MALE population numbers as follows:

* Time span: 1990--2040
* Column category: malepopulation
* Age range: 60--80 years old

Use `ggplot()` to create your plot and be sure to label x and y axes and give the
plot a descriptive title.
