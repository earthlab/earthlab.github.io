## Results

.outline-header[results]

## Present 1-3 most important findings

Remember that in general, people don't remember lots of details. IN a presentation
your goal should be that they walk away with 2-4 key points. It's not a lot but
would you rather them walk away with nothing or a few key points and your contact
information?
