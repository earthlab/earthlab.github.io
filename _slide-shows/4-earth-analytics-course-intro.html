### We have students learning both online and in person

* 11 undergrads  (5 online)
* 17 undergrads (1 online)
* 2? auditing (TBD)

???
Please note that we have people participating in the course both online
and in person this fall! Thus we will adjust how the course is taught based
on that throughout the semester! Also note that our course includes a mixture
of students from various backgrounds!

## You will learn how to make plots like this!

```r
class_list2 %>%
  group_by(first_major, degree) %>%
  summarize(count = n()) %>%
ggplot(aes(x = degree, y = count)) +
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity', fill = "darkorchid4") +
  facet_wrap(~ first_major) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(title = "Students by Major",
       subtitle = "Earth analytics fall 2017",
       x = "Main major", y = "Count")

## Help me improve your experience

* Class surveys: emailed Mondays @9am
* Check your "spam" or "junk" mail for the email!
* Help me improve this class!

???
every week,  I will be email u a survey through QUALTRICS. This survey
is completely optional however I appreciate your taking it. It will allow
me to adjust the course throughout the semester to ensure everyone is
getting the best experience possible! it also will help be gauge how long
the homeworks are taking, how the pace of the class is for everyone... and more.
I appreciate your help me improve this class!

## About your instructor

* Background in remote sensing ecology
* Learned data skills ... the hard way

???
I have a degree in ecology with a focus on remote sensing. I learned how to
program because my dissertation data were so large -- gb of lidar point clouds
and i needed a way to work with them. At the time I knew GIS- specifically
ArcGIS very well. However, I had never programmed and didn't know a lot about
dealing with point clouds. I tried to develop workflows in ArcGIS however i
ran into problems trying to work with the huge datasets... everything
crashed!

Some friends got me started programming with Matlab ... the rest is history...
I didn't think I could learn this stuff... I am not a programmer.
I am a teacher and a scientist. If I can, you can learn it to.

You can't address big science questions with only one discipline of
expertise involved. Thus, Earth lab is interdisciplinary

Now that you know a bit about earth lab, let's talk about the goals of this
class and how they fit into the realm of both understanding global change and
what skills you need to get a job these days.

## Skills required to address big questions with big data

1. Data skills (programming, efficient workflows, version control, command line)
2. Interdisciplinary collaboration skills
3. Communication -- to different audiences


???
As a part of my job at earth lab, i'm building a earth-analytics program.
We are focused on understanding the job market and the skills that we should
be teaching here at CU. So you get better jobs!!

R vs. Python??

![r vs python - which one to learn ]({{ site.url }}/images/slide-shows/earth-analytics-course/fall-2017/r-vs-python.png)

*just learn one well!*

???
One of the most popular question that people ask me are what language should
I learn. Each language has it's benefits and associated challenges.
The main take away is to learn one well. That knowledge to think programmatically
transfers to
other languages ONCE you have it.

|   Skill  | Why      | Examples |
|:---------|:----------|:------|
| **Unix command line**  | Fast file manipulation, command line interfaces with tools (AWS, etc)     |   GitBash   |
| **Cloud computing** |    |  Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure   |

*GEOG 4463 / 5463 - Python Bootcamp - Augmester 2018 provides many of these skills.*

There are a set of skills that you would benefit from learning. The ones
above are a good starting point.

## Open science & reproducibility

* **Help your future self:** A well documented project is easier to work with 6 months down the road.

???
You may be wondering -- why should i care about open science and reproducibility.
1. Open science refers making your workflows open so that someone else can reproduce your work.
This doesn't benefit the community of science of a whole but also benefits you.
Imagine having to redo plots 6 months down the road after getting a journal review back.
If your plots are easy to reproduce and your methods well documented... the time
involved in redoing the effort will be less!

---
class: center, inverse

## Open science & reproducibility

* **Push science forward:** Others can push forward the work that you're doing. You can push forward the work others are doing.

???
By documenting your work, the next person who picks it up doesn't have to start over.
Also in a peer review process your methods are completely transparent. This helps
science as a whole move forward

### Data come from our daily lives too

How many people are woken up by Earth Quakes in the California, Bay Area?

![ ]({{ site.url }}/images/slide-shows/earth-analytics-course/wk1-intro-earth-analytics/image19.png)

???
Car emissions, citizen scientists, social media data, text analysis.

From Jawbone, Earthquake in Napa in 2014:
The recent earthquake in South Napa took many by surprise during the night, but
 to see just how many people woke up to the sound and physical disturbance,
  fitness tracking company Jawbone has released some anonymous data. The chart
   shared shows UP wearers in the Bay Area who track their sleep patterns.
break
A serious portion of UP wearers in Napa, Sonoma, Vallejo and Fairfield are
located near the epicenter and were woken up, but it's interesting to see just
 how the impact gradually weakened as data from users who reside slightly
  further away is included. If you thought your UP was just for monitoring
  fitness, how about a secondary feature for earthquakes?
