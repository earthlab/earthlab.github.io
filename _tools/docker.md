Docker provides a platform for reproducible workflows and cloud computing, where your software is bundled up with all of the dependencies and a lightweight operating system. 
Earth Lab curates Docker images for spatial analysis in R and Python. 
Feel free to use these in your own work, whether you're running a small analysis locally or setting up a Docker swarm cluster in the cloud!
