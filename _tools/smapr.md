smapr is an R package for acquisition and processing of [NASA (Soil Moisture Active-Passive) SMAP data](http://smap.jpl.nasa.gov/).
The NASA SMAP mission collects global soil moisture daily, providing an invaluable resource to the research community.
The smapr package facilitates data search, download, and processing, with the goal of quickly acquiring georeferenced spatial rasters that can be exported to any desired format.
