###### A Python script to download fire data from [GeoMAC](http://www.geomac.gov/)

[GeoMAC](http://www.geomac.gov/) (Geospatial Multi-Agency Coordination Group) is an application from USGS which hosts and distributes fire data. Data from GeoMAC is downloaded as a KMZ (zipped KML file) with user-specified layers and formatting. Once downloaded, this data can be viewed with applications such as [Google Earth](https://www.google.com/earth/)
