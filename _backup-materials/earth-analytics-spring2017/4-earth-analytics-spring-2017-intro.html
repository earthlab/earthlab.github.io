# CU Boulder’s Grand Challenge

Our world is facing significant issues with a changing environment,
increasing populations and limited resources.
The intersection of people,
resources and our planet is where CU-Boulder can use its expertise in
space-based observation and exploration to address our world’s most pressing
problems.

### Data are attached to everything

Car emissions, citizen scientists, social media data, text analysis.

From Jawbone, Earthquake in Napa in 2014:
The recent earthquake in South Napa took many by surprise during the night, but
 to see just how many people woke up to the sound and physical disturbance,
  fitness tracking company Jawbone has released some anonymous data. The chart
   shared shows UP wearers in the Bay Area who track their sleep patterns.
break
A serious portion of UP wearers in Napa, Sonoma, Vallejo and Fairfield are
located near the epicenter and were woken up, but it's interesting to see just
 how the impact gradually weakened as data from users who reside slightly
  further away is included. If you thought your UP was just for monitoring
  fitness, how about a secondary feature for earthquakes?

## Data integration
![ ]({{ site.url }}/images/slide-shows/earth-analytics-course/wk1-intro-earth-analytics/image22.jpg)

???
Earth Lab is built on a few key premises, including that data is gold, but its
the integration that brings tremendous value.

## Data recombination

![ ]({{ site.url }}/images/slide-shows/earth-analytics-course/wk1-intro-earth-analytics/image23.png)

???
There is great power in harnessing existing data and integrating it in new and
innovative ways to address new questions.

## Collaboration networks

![ ]({{ site.url }}/images/slide-shows/earth-analytics-course/wk1-intro-earth-analytics/image24.png)

???
From Darwin to today. It took Darwin an entire lifetime to collect the data he
needed to fully form the concept of evolution. We have the opportunity today
to create many Darwins in a very short period of time. To accelerate discovery
with rapid testing of new ideas and theory. But it’s no longer a game of an
individual with leather patches sitting alone in his office in the ivory
Tower, it’s also about decentralizing the scientific process and building
strong collaboration networks.
