## Learn Methods for Reproducible Science, Automated Workflows and Version Control -

Reproducible science refers to sharing methods and workflows used in a project.
One aspect of making your science reproducible, is automating your workflow using
scientific programming. If your code is automated and well documented, then
someone else could run the same analysis on your data and thus build upon your
work. Reproducibility in Earth data science encourages sharing of knowledge and
techniques so that scientific efforts can build off each other. In the lessons
below, learn how to write clean, reproducible code. Also learn how to share
your code and collaborate effectively using version control tools like Git and GitHub.
