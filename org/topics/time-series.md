## About Time Series Data

Time series data are used to understand changes over time in our environment.
For instance, you can collect temperature data over time to track how
temperature fluctuates, hourly, daily monthly and even annually. However often
working with dates and times in tools like `R` and `Python` can be tricky given
different date and time formats and time zones. Learn how to work with, clean
up and plot time series data in the R programming language in the lessons below.
Stay tuned for `Python` lessons!
