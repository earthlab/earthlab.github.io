## Use R, Python and Other Open Tools For GIS

Most scientific data are geographically located and thus have a spatial component.
GIS skills are thus important for working with scientific data. `R` and `Python` are
free and open scientific programming languages that you can use to work with GIS
data and do tasks that you may already do with tools like ArcGIS or QGIS.

In the lessons below, learn how to open, manipulate and plot spatial data in the
R programming language. Also learn to use tools like `Leaflet` and `ggplot` to create
custom and interactive maps. Finally learn how to use remote sensing data like
Landsat, NAIP and MODIS in `R`. Come back later this spring for lessons in Python!
