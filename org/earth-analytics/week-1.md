### Part 2
The second part of your homework assignment is to review the two sets of lessons below. Following the lessons, setup `R`, `Rstudio` and a
`working directory` that will contain the data we will use for week one and the
rest of the semester on your laptop.

Once everything is setup, complete the second set of lessons which walk you
through creating R markdown documents and knitting them to .pdf format.If you already know `rmarkdown`, be sure to review the lessons anyway - particularly
the ones about file organization and why we use this workflow in science.
