## <i class="fa fa-ship" aria-hidden="true"></i> Welcome to Week One!

Welcome to week one of Earth Analytics! In week 1 we will explore data together
in class related to the 2013 Colorado Floods. In your homework, you will set
`R` and `RStudio` setup on your laptop and learn how to create an R Markdown
document and convert it to a pdf using `knitr`.

## <i class="fa fa-pencil"></i> Homework Week 1


### 1. Watch Flood Video
First, watch this video to learn more about the 2013 Colorado floods and some
of the data that can be used to better understand the drivers and impacts of those
floods.

View Slideshow: Share, Publish & Archive Code & Data</a>

### 3. Review Lessons
The second part of your homework assignment is to review the homework lessons (see links
on the left hand side of this page).
Following the lessons, setup `R`, `RStudio` and a
`working directory` that will contain the data we will use for week one and the
rest of the semester on your laptop.

Once everything is setup, complete the second set of lessons which walk you
through creating R markdown documents and knitting them to `.pdf` format. If you
already know `rmarkdown`, be sure to review the lessons anyway - particularly
the ones about file organization and why we use this workflow in science.

<i class="fa fa-star" aria-hidden="true"></i> **Important:** Review
ALL of the lessons and have your computer setup BEFORE class begins next week.
You will be behind if these things are not setup / complete before week 2.
