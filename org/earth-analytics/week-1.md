Welcome to week one of Earth Analytics! In this week we will explore data together
in class related to the 2013 Colorado Floods -  natural disturbance event that
had significant impacts on people across the state of Colorado.

## In Class Lessons
* [In Class](/course-materials/earth-analytics/week-1/co-floods-1-intro/)

## Homework

Your homework for this week is to setup the following things on your laptop that
you will use in class each week:

1. `R`
1. `Rstudio` and a
1. `working directory` that will contain  the data we will use for week one and the
rest of the semester

Once everything is setup on your laptop, complete the assignment below.
In this assignment, you will:

1. Learn about and create an `rmarkdown` report.
2. `Knit` that report to a `.PDF` format.

Don't worry, you may not know what `rmarkdown` and `knit` means, but you will after
completing the lessons below.

If you already know `rmarkdown`, be sure to review the lessons anyway - particularly
the ones about file organization and why we use this workflow in science.
