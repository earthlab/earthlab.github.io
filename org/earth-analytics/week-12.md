Welcome to week {{ page.week }} of Earth Analytics! This week we will discuss
the use of social media data to better understand change as it impacts humans.
Specifically we will talk about natural disasters and how Twitter data can be
used to better understand these events. We will work together in R to access the
Twitter API and analyze tweets using various text mining approaches.
