## <i class="fa fa-pencil-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> Final project

Select a science question that you wish to address or a phenomenon or event that you wish to better understand. It can be related to something we've covered in class or to something completely different! However, you have to be able to answer questions about the topic using data!

You will research the topic that you select finding papers and other documentation about it. You will also find data that can be used to better understand the phenomenon / science question of interest.

**Final project group presentation: Wednesday 3 May 2017 during class.**

**Final individual project due: Submit to D2L by Tuesday 9 May 2017 @ 5PM.**

</div>

## Final group presentation (20%)
For your final, as a group, you will present the following:

* The study area that you selected for your project
* The science topic that you selected for your project.
* Why the topic / event / phenomenon is important (why should the class care) - this should include some background that you develop via a literature review.
* Atleast 2 different types of data from different sources that allow you to answer questions about the topic.
* Where you got the data and how you processed the data.
* Results that you found by looking at the data.
* Challenges that you faced in working with the data
* Any relevant conclusions.

#### Important:

* You have no more than **10 minutes** to present your project to the class.
* Each member in each group needs to present!
* You can use any presentation tool that you wish for your presentation. Powerpoint, rpres, pdf, etc. As long as the entire class can see the final presentation and you can SUBMIT IT to D2l.
* Groups should be 2-3 people. It is ok if you decide you really want to work on your own but we prefer (and you will have a better project) if you work with others.
* You can reach out to the folks who have presented in this course for guidance / with questions if you want!

## Individual Final Report (20%)
To complement your final presentation, you will also create a knitr based report that summarizes your class project. For your report, select a component of the project that you are most interested in and write a report about it. This will require you to do some research. In your report be sure to cite atleast 3 journal articles about that topic. Also be sure to include data driven plots and maps as appropriate. Your report should include

1. An introduction that includes a map of the study area created in R and a literature review that includes references to atleast 3 scientific (peer reviewed) papers on the topic.
2. An overview of the methods - what data did you use and how did you process it in `R`.
3. Results - *atleast* 4 maps / plots that answer the question that you decided to address or the phenomenon that you decided to explore using data.
4. Summary text - what did you learn about your topic? What did the data tell you?

The report should be written INDEPENDENTLY. We will check for this when grading. However it is OK if you decide to share code with your colleagues given you may all tackle different parts of the data when you work on your project. It is also ok if you share interesting articles and other sources of information about the topic.

The writing of each report however needs to be your own.


## Graduate students - additional report elements
In addition to the requirement above, graduate students should develop

1. A more robust literature review on the selected topic. This review should include 5 or more references
and should be 1.5 to 2 pages in length (~700 words). We won't be counting words, we
simply want you to create a robust literature review that is of the quality of a
review that you would include in a paper.
2. An abstract that provides the big picture of the topic that you selected. this abstract should follow the format of an abstract that would write for a journal submission in your field.
