presenting your science - to better prepare you for your mid term presentation
next week!

### Overview

Your task for this week is to prepare for your mid-term presentation & quiz.
Both will be performed in class NEXT WEEK.

* [Review the mid term assignment page which contains a suggested study area list.]({{ site.url }}/course-materials/earth-analytics/mid-term/)



## Mid-Term Grade rubric

A full rubric will be posted on the mid-term landing page. In the meantime, please consider
the following things as you put your talk together:

* **Presentation structure**
  * Introduction,
  * Background,
  * Project importance,
  * Methods,
  * Example results: We know you won't have results in time for the mid term. But you should know enough about your project to know what type of results you expect to see.
* **Data:** clearly present what data you intend to use.
* **Content:**
  * A science question that you wish to address or a phenomenon or event that you wish to better understand. It can be related to something we've covered in class or to something completely different!
  * An overview of the data types and sources that you intend to use to answer your science question.
  * An overview of the study area you will be working in.
  * An overview of what you think you'll find working on your project.
* Everyone in your group needs to present!
