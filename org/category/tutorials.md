<div id = "left" markdown="1">Scientific programming can be used to efficiently
work with many different types of data. Rather than performing tasks manually,
you can write code that opens, cleans and processes your data. However, often
figuring out how to perform a specific task in `R`, `Python` or another programming
language can be tricky. In the tutorials below, you will learn how to use `R`,
`Python` and `Javascript` programming languages to perform specific tasks
including calculating slope in a digital elevation model or using Leaflet to
create an interactive map.
